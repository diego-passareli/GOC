34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,159
>> Okay. Well,

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,840
I was brought up in the church, thank

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,000
God. My parents uh come from a village

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,400
in northern Greece

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,960
uh was a Slav speaking village and uh so

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,439
you know it was hearing the church

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,280
savonic of course was somewhat

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,600
recognizable but I I grew up mostly the

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,680
the Greek parish of St. Nario in Toronto

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,840
and uh my uh my grandmother left a very

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,360
deep influence in my life. She was uh

45
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,200
the one that led us all to that church

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,360
basically.

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,439
Her sister actually the the parish was

48
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,840
uh we had around 500 families. It's very

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,600
large parish

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,159
and um St. Tyrus himself would appear to

51
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,840
people and sometimes and tell them I

52
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,760
want you to go to my parish. And uh

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,720
my grandmother had doubts actually about

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,400
the uh old calendar because you know the

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,160
old-timers in that area were uh very

56
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,280
much staunch defenders of the uh

57
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,760
traditions of the church. And so um

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,480
uh she had a few uh major miracles which

59
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,160
confirmed

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,959
that uh that it's not a small issue that

61
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,400
the church needs to hold on to the

62
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
traditions that disunityity in the

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,920
church was uh began with the change of

64
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,560
the calendar and of course it to this

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,040
day um those people in those

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
jurisdictions patriarchets don't

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,560
celebrate together and sometimes they

68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,120
celebrate two times

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,040
uh you know clergy from Greece, bishops

70
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,400
from Greece will go to Mount Aus and

71
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,760
celebrate the old calendar in the day

72
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,760
celebrate the new calendar

73
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,440
and uh she was just a very saintly

74
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,879
person you know she she a lot of people

75
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,080
could say you know my grandmother

76
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,200
brought me to church and all this kind

77
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,560
of stuff but it was it was really beyond

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,239
that it was super human it was uh was

79
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,879
someone who um

80
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,120
just loved God so much you read

81
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
sometimes in the lives of the saints

82
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,599
It's it you know only grace could could

83
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,920
u aid these people to be so cetical and

84
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,680
um so without any exception it was

85
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,720
always all day all night prayers

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,319
she just continuously making the sign on

87
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,599
the cross always praying and and just a

88
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,920
beautiful example which I cannot really

89
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,599
imitate quite frankly because it was

90
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,120
above

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,159
uh and and there were just so many signs

92
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,319
of real grace in this person and and the

93
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,000
first few years of my life we sort of

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,319
lived in

95
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,799
area of Toronto which is called Danforth

96
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,519
very close to Greek town.

97
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,680
So we lived very close just a couple

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,840
blocks away from my grandmother and so

99
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,079
as a child I would I would spend a lot

100
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,639
of time there at sleepover for extended

101
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,079
periods of time. Then we moved and then

102
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,680
they would spend extended periods, my

103
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,840
grandparents would uh spend extended

104
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,639
periods of time with us. And the system

105
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,000
that we had was that my grandfather

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,720
would stay in the um spare room and my

107
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,240
grandmother would stay in my room and

108
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,720
she she'd just be praying all night all

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,600
all night. And she just like literally

110
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,240
all night tears growing going through

111
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,000
her eyes. I remember you know waking up

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,320
with her hands up and she just streaming

113
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,160
tears

114
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,720
and uh it didn't bother me. I was

115
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,280
because you know from the time I was as

116
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,160
long as I can remember um

117
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,440
you know I was very much into uh I went

118
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,600
to church and I I I I loved going to

119
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,280
church and I

120
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,000
>> I said my my mother God bless her you

121
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,479
know she brought us up in the faith but

122
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,320
my grandmother was the one my mother was

123
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,479
pious my grandmother's

124
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,400
holy

125
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,479
and um

126
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,240
so she left an influence in the family

127
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
everybody

128
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,479
went to uh synctic taris. She sort of

129
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,199
led the way

130
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,840
and um

131
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
as I said it was it was really all night

132
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,479
long prayers and and unbelievable

133
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,000
fasting and uh so I I grew up hearing

134
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,919
things from the old country. You know

135
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,639
how they uh it was almost like we were

136
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,759
in this protected little

137
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,720
>> nucleus and uh she would tell me about

138
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,880
things back in the old country and

139
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,120
sometimes about specifically about the

140
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,759
church calendar issues and how the

141
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,360
faithful and how the grandmother who

142
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,759
lived with her

143
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,800
who subsequently was uh her ending was

144
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,560
so blessed that she told everybody okay

145
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
I'm going to be dying she

146
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,199
>> she yeah what happened was that her

147
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,400
guard heard an angel appeared to her and

148
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,680
told her, "I'm taking your soul." And

149
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,520
then she said, "No, don't take it yet

150
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,199
because I need to see Paul, my

151
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,160
grandfather, who was uh it was just

152
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,680
before Pasca, so he was in the other

153
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,919
villages selling meat because we were

154
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,160
sort of well off and he had a lot of

155
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,400
livestock and and um as soon as he came

156
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,240
home,

157
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
um she took off her head covering. She

158
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,160
was she was 105 years old at this time.

159
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,680
It's 1950s.

160
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,280
>> And she threw all of her hairs on my

161
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,560
grandparents head. And she said, "As

162
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,319
many hairs as I have, so many blessings

163
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,160
may you have. Please forgive me. I'm

164
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,080
leaving. My guardian angel came to take

165
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,240
my soul. We made a an agreement."

166
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,479
And then um

167
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,440
so and then she reposed right there and

168
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,319
she she told them she made a point

169
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,600
uh to follow the church calendar. Uh she

170
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,360
would not even though the local church

171
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,039
there was celebrating with the new

172
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,240
calendar.

173
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,440
>> Mhm.

174
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,039
uh

175
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,400
then um so that was a blessing for me.

176
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,840
It's also uh it centers me because like

177
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,800
I said it's above what I could ever be.

178
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,160
Then uh in 1988 we made our first trip

179
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
to Greece

180
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,120
and as a family and we visited my my

181
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,800
mother's aunt who lived in Kerata.

182
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,960
She lived right by the convent there and

183
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,599
there there was a a famous uh holy fool

184
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,520
for Christ's sake.

185
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,639
Uh and I I saw her on numerous occasions

186
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,800
during that that trip and that was a

187
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,400
real uh deep experience and it was a

188
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,800
real blessing for me

189
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,080
and I always wanted to become a

190
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,599
monastic. So my plan was to go to Mount

191
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,400
Aos and providentially

192
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,479
I found someone

193
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,680
who was uh in the desert uh of Mount Aos

194
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,199
and I had a correspondence with him from

195
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,000
time I was 14 years old and finally when

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,919
I was 19 I went and visited him and

197
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,599
stayed with him and I my plan was to

198
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,039
stay with him and to become a monk

199
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,720
there.

200
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Um

201
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,319
the bishop in Toronto talked me out of

202
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,080
it. The clergy sort of talked me out of

203
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,840
it

204
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,039
and um part of me is has uh is bothered

205
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,039
by that.

206
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,800
But I know that uh you know God's God's

207
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
plans, God's work, of course, God's

208
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,880
will.

209
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,880
And um this elder was way beyond what I

210
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,279
could ever imagine. I mean I thought I

211
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,959
remember because I had a habit of

212
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,640
writing letters to different shrines as

213
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,440
a child and I would ask for prayers and

214
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,880
ask them to light candles and ask them

215
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,640
to send holy oil and everything. But

216
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,000
when I got my first correspondence from

217
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,440
Elder Joel command I understood this is

218
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,839
different. This is somebody who's has to

219
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,880
be has to have a lot of grace. So when I

220
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,440
went there um I was deemed worthy to

221
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,640
stay with him for a while and they sort

222
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,680
of had me like a novice and uh you know

223
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,200
I was I didn't have a bless to talk to

224
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,519
visitors if they came by.

225
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,000
Ironically, you know the famous father

226
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,320
friend of

227
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
>> Kathon

228
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,519
>> from what I understand he actually told

229
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,959
the new calendars that that was a holy

230
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,040
man of the joy.

231
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,399
>> So new calendars would pass by uh while

232
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,959
I was there and um it was one of St.

233
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,000
Narus's hideouts and St. Narus

234
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,720
uh used to go there because the

235
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,640
spiritual grandfather of the Jokim whose

236
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,959
name was

237
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,600
friends with St. Narus,

238
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,920
the elder of Elder Yakim was present at

239
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,959
the appearance of the cross in 1925. His

240
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,480
name was Elder Nectario

241
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,360
and he was uh you know Elder Join

242
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,680
basically was like one of the fathers.

243
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,320
He was uh deep in the prayer. He would

244
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,920
never leave the mountain. He was uh he

245
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,200
would hardly go anywhere else. He was

246
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,360
just there in the desert saying his

247
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,920
prayers. And uh I'm telling you it was

248
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,760
just unbeliev I don't there aren't

249
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,880
people like that. I don't know if there

250
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,000
any if there's anybody like that

251
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
anymore. He was a succession of the

252
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,320
older Aayoras the fathers from Manathos

253
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
and

254
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,640
it's a man of God really.

255
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,040
>> Mhm.

256
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,519
>> And and we have here his vestments and

257
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,360
some of his relics and and actually he's

258
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,120
worked miracles.

259
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,640
So he works miracles and he you know we

260
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
feel his presence. So when somebody says

261
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,040
for example you know

262
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,480
uh how can we not accept u whatever

263
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,160
other elders or saints you know um I

264
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
mean this is what I know

265
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,519
>> this these are the people that uh led me

266
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,600
to Christ

267
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
and I have no doubt in my mind that

268
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,640
these were just people who were u

269
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,560
inspired by the Holy Spirit who deeply

270
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,600
had God in them whose very presence was

271
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,399
something very special

272
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,720
and I remember just the holy fool for

273
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,480
grac Daro when I first saw it was sort

274
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
of like a shock because the presence was

275
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,240
just so strong

276
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,399
and then Elder Join when he served he

277
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,560
was he was in another world he was

278
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,120
totally totally

279
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,480
enveloped in God's grace

280
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,399
so uh that you know in short those

281
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,000
people left a deep impression on me I uh

282
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,360
As I said, I wanted to become a monk

283
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,680
there with the holy other jok. And um

284
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,880
I wasn't even worthy to do that. But uh

285
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,240
I ended up uh what the bishop wanted me

286
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,200
to do was the bishop in Toronto who

287
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,040
reposed a few months ago, God, God have

288
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,000
mercy on his soul. God forgive him and

289
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,440
uh grant him whatever rest

290
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,000
is available from the Lord's by the

291
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,360
Lord's mercy and grace. um

292
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,200
he he wanted to start a small little

293
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,680
monastic community and so he told me go

294
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
to Boston for 6 months to 2 years and

295
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,160
then uh you'll come back because I

296
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,600
really never was interested in becoming

297
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,680
a monk in Boston actually.

298
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,079
>> Mhm.

299
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,399
>> And um but what happened was uh when I

300
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,279
brought it up to the uh the yand of the

301
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,040
monastery actually was the ab monaster's

302
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,800
father Isaac

303
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,160
um he really took it personally. He was

304
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,000
he didn't want to you know I was young

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,279
blood and everything I guess he just

306
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,880
didn't want to lose me.

307
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,079
>> Mhm.

308
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,560
>> And uh the plan Metropol mar's plan the

309
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,240
bishop of Toronto just fizzled out

310
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,320
and I was there and I stayed there for

311
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,079
around 18 years.

312
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:40,480
>> Mhm.

313
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,959
>> And uh they made me a bishop you know

314
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,240
after 10 years. I was 31

315
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,800
uh 11 years and um and from the very

316
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,320
beginning I was talking about uniting

317
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,480
with our church because it's one of the

318
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,399
things that all the join serve I you

319
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,880
know I I um I really think it's his

320
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,560
prayers too and his blessings and St.

321
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,519
John who was a friend of bishop Petros

322
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,160
of Atoria

323
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,680
uh because it was right after I visited

324
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,279
St. John in San Francisco for the first

325
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,279
time that things started really moving

326
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,279
but from the very beginning uh everybody

327
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,920
knows this I wasn't hiding it I I kept

328
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,880
saying we need to unite with the uh sen

329
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,240
>> finally we came to the uh conclusion

330
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,279
actually decision hna decided in 2010

331
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,320
that the canonical senate in Greece is

332
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
um the senate under archbishop of

333
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
kalinos

334
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,760
it was right after the repose of

335
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,120
Archbishop Bros. We sent uh letters of

336
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,760
condolences. I went personally the sit

337
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,120
>> and uh I think that the Lord wanted us

338
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,160
to um confess our faith because it's not

339
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,959
as if what I considered

340
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,519
um a perfect opportunity for them silver

341
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,360
platter for the entire for all of them

342
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,600
to go over there and just humble

343
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,480
themselves like like the former

344
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
Cyprianites did you know I have to say

345
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,440
Metropolan Kipos Jr.

346
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,240
Mhm.

347
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,839
>> Uh

348
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,920
uh Bishop Clement, Bishop Ambrose, they

349
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,199
all asked for prayer, forgiveness

350
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,839
took off their panas

351
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,760
and this was edifying.

352
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,480
>> Mhm.

353
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,399
>> Uh so um so that's you know that's the

354
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,760
whole the whole u idea is being humbled

355
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,560
and and so and being humble and going

356
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,079
back because repentance heals. So this

357
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,839
is the reason why I um I I went on my

358
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,120
own because they um

359
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,440
they started fighting back. They didn't

360
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,680
want after afterwards they didn't want

361
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
to um

362
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,839
join Arsenad and they started defaming

363
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,160
Arsen. And this is why I recognize this

364
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,000
from the side groups.

365
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,560
>> Mhm.

366
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,240
>> Because they have to have some type of

367
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,000
uh

368
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,160
point for their existence because a lot

369
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,959
of them don't have a reason to exist.

370
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:07,279
Yeah.

371
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,120
>> And uh and so they're saying that

372
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,639
whatever they can throw out, it's it

373
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,399
reminds me very much of the phariseaical

374
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,279
thing about, you know, just catch him at

375
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,079
his words, try to find something against

376
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,519
him. And so they did that and they're

377
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,040
saying things like we're cypriites.

378
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,959
People who,

379
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,440
by the way, were in communion with the

380
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,399
cypriionites when they were crianites.

381
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,480
>> And now that they're not crianites,

382
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,199
they're pointing fingers. So in any

383
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,680
case, um

384
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,199
I went off a little bit on that, but the

385
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,920
thing is I do want to uh stress that it

386
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,199
was a beautiful addition to our senate

387
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,160
and that they were uh in an edifying way

388
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,480
very they came in a with humility

389
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,160
>> and that's how I went to the senad when

390
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,480
I had to leave on my own because of the

391
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,160
circumstances and I went to the

392
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,000
archbishop and I said I'm coming in

393
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,320
repentance

394
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
and uh as I said that's what what brings

395
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,079
his healing uh because uh you know there

396
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,440
was a little bit of a gray area with

397
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,519
Archishbentios and because he was

398
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,600
formerly the archbishop. So on Manos

399
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,279
what happened was in the 80s and 90s up

400
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,880
until his repose there was still a

401
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,320
little bit of consolation going on

402
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,600
between the two factions clergy from the

403
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,120
two groups would conceal at the

404
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,639
monastery of his men.

405
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,399
Uh

406
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,160
but even you know I learned from Elder

407
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,720
Joakim that uh who who personally

408
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,399
respected our church bakant just like a

409
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,000
lot of people in our church you know

410
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,639
you'll find his photograph everywhere

411
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,320
>> and uh for the record he u

412
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,959
he wanted to resign and he wanted

413
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,880
everybody to go under our church but he

414
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,560
was talked out of it by some clergy in

415
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,240
Boston at the time unfortunately

416
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,839
uh that could have been healed and but

417
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,360
anyway may God remember his good

418
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,600
intentions and he was humble about the

419
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,079
fact that he made a lot of mistakes.

420
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,039
>> Mhm. And uh some of the people who try

421
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,559
to defend him like um the so-called

422
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,480
Macarian you know the they used to be

423
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,919
called the Libyans

424
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,799
>> they used to they now sort of try to

425
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,640
present themselves as the Oxentian

426
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,720
faction but

427
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,000
truth you know the truth of the matter

428
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,919
is actually Hopner was they were the

429
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,720
ones that uh buried Arches Bakantius and

430
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,240
the Marian Center was not in community

431
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,559
with Archish Bantius

432
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,640
and so what happens then is that Um

433
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,520
the um

434
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,000
they would bring up a a quote from a

435
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,559
cannon the ancient apostolic cannons

436
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,440
that the uh sinnard can do nothing

437
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,880
without the archbishop but they forgot

438
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,240
the second part of the canon which says

439
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,679
the archbishop can do nothing without

440
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,600
the sin and that was part of the problem

441
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,160
that was it led to such chaos which

442
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,400
people in Boston were saying too

443
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,320
>> up until the point where they joined

444
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,840
But like I said, you know, he's in

445
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,360
Argipics.

446
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,440
He's um almost everybody from his

447
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,880
jurisdiction ended up joining our

448
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,679
church, including his last real bishop,

449
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,440
which was Metropolitan Athanasius of

450
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,799
Lisa.

451
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,120
>> Mhm.

452
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,600
>> And so I went there. I went to the

453
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,720
Senate in Greece and uh was accepted and

454
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,799
and thank God and we didn't have to deal

455
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,280
with the major headaches of some of

456
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,360
these splinter groups.

457
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,799
>> Yeah.

458
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,320
Yeah.

459
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,440
So, in short, that's, you know,

460
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,039
I want to go on and on about all this,

461
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,799
but that's basically where where I am

462
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,640
now, how I got here.

463
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,520
>> So, after you got received into the GOC,

464
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,440
you ended up um this was after Hawkna

465
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,520
basically fell apart in was it 201

466
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,679
14?

467
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,440
in two well things started getting

468
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,960
really bad in uh

469
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,480
well you know the very beginnings of

470
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,200
course are questionable but um things

471
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,840
started getting bad a few years before

472
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,280
that

473
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,600
>> um they always had this tendency of it's

474
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,440
a temptation from the right of let's

475
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,679
let's have a new fight

476
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,280
>> so you know it's the toll house fight

477
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,160
it's the trinity icon fight it's the um

478
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,640
we can't stand father no rose fight it's

479
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,280
uh

480
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,120
>> it just there's no peace this is not not

481
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,640
the gospel.

482
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,320
>> So um and then it finally it turned into

483
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,120
uh and there was this um

484
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,679
awake sleeper fight. This is after soul

485
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,000
sleeping. It's a major thing about soul

486
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,919
sleeping and then they had this awake

487
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,840
sleeper

488
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,960
anyway and then uh there's no end to it

489
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,880
and and we would make decisions that

490
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,280
everything would be overturned. It was

491
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,679
it was

492
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,080
>> then uh lastly it was the name

493
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,919
worshipping thing

494
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,520
>> and my main point about that was don't

495
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,120
even don't even go there. I remember

496
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,480
somebody came to me who ended up

497
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,960
becoming the major uh uh defender

498
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,360
of the these teachings when he was a

499
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,679
novice and I said I don't know much he

500
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,600
asked me do you do you sympathize with

501
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,799
the name worshippers and I said back

502
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,320
then nobody even knew what they were

503
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,559
really and I said well I don't know much

504
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,640
about it but let me tell you that I know

505
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
that if you bring it up to so and so a

506
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,480
certain church leader of hawkna it's

507
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,160
going to be the new fight please don't

508
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,840
bring it up to him

509
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,120
>> he brought it up to him and it became

510
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,280
the new fight And so then that became

511
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,200
the big thing and I was just saying why

512
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,360
are we getting into these like there's

513
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,120
no reason to even talk about this. It's

514
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,559
an indication of some type of a

515
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,559
sickness.

516
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,280
>> And um you know the church has spoken

517
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,039
about it.

518
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,039
We don't need to. And that was the other

519
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,919
issue which was always saying it's like

520
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,240
why are you always questioning the

521
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,679
saints? Like why are you coming up with

522
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,760
this super duper orthodoxy thing which

523
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,840
is just going to fall apart anyway? He

524
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,360
said he prophesied it's going to fall

525
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
apart.

526
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,080
>> So um

527
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,520
yeah and I didn't I just didn't want to

528
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,039
have anything to do with it.

529
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:01,360
>> Yeah. Yeah.

530
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,520
>> So, you know, you have an apart, which

531
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,039
is what they call themselves. The park

532
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,720
sinn goes to the mother church, which we

533
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,400
recognized in 2010

534
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,679
>> uh uh to solve the problems. And I went

535
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,360
directly to the mother church to the

536
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,240
church that we're under that I'm part of

537
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,360
uh uh a member of the sin out of. And um

538
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,919
you know, it's night and day. May God

539
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,679
protect the church. May God protect us

540
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,919
in the church. And uh we need to pray

541
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,120
for that. And as I told you previously

542
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,960
that

543
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,480
uh it's a dangerous thing to fight

544
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,039
against the church and uh everybody

545
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,480
who's in the outskirts should be coming

546
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,240
here quite frankly.

547
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,360
>> Yeah.

548
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,880
>> As I said I don't believe in I don't

549
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,799
believe in gok.

550
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,120
>> Yeah.

551
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,960
>> This is the go

552
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,080
>> the one

553
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,039
>> it's the go

554
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,080
and those who are groups know that.

555
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,880
>> Yeah. So when you went to Greece and

556
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,159
they were received you were you

557
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,520
automatically made a member of the

558
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,720
cinnid?

559
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,840
>> Yes.

560
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,919
>> Yeah. And but were you you weren't

561
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,440
Metropolitan right away though, right?

562
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,400
Or were

563
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,159
>> No. What happened was I had already had

564
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,400
contacts with the Senate and and to give

565
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,799
you a brief history as I said from the

566
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,880
very beginning I wanted to find a way to

567
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,400
come into contact with the Senate and

568
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,840
all I could do was pray about it because

569
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,440
I was told by the leadership over there

570
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,280
and this is my first year so I can't

571
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,200
just do whatever I want, right?

572
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,880
>> Yeah. I was told by the leadership over

573
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,240
there, we can't go to them. They have to

574
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,640
come to us because we're the Gonical

575
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,080
Church of Greece. That was their whole

576
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,280
mentality.

577
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,600
>> Mhm.

578
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
>> And lo and behold, they did come to us.

579
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,320
I got phone calls uh and I believe it

580
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,760
was an answer to prayer because I was

581
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,039
praying about it. I got phone calls from

582
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,760
Greece and from America. One of them was

583
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,720
from uh an old friend of mine who I met

584
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,799
on Mount Aos in 1994 who's now bishop uh

585
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,840
Metropolitan Christian. I met him when

586
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,120
he was a priest monk. He was a young

587
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,720
priest monk. He was at Beno when I

588
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,039
visited Eseno under Yandio.

589
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,600
And um

590
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,080
Bishop Maximos of Pelonia was in Harik

591
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,159
and he called me

592
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,000
just out of the blue left a message

593
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,480
there. Then uh I think Father Sos called

594
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
me. There was Anastasio

595
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,840
Hudson whom you know he goes to the

596
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,400
parish over there in Maryland. Yeah. Uh

597
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,120
he came and visited me actually because

598
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,559
they had heard that there's a bishop in

599
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,720
Hoffnet who actually talks about the

600
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,039
unity of the church. And so they thought

601
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,240
that I might you know be able to uh do

602
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,440
something about trying to uh bring about

603
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,760
unity in America. And um and so that

604
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,120
opened the door for me because I

605
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,799
couldn't contact them but they had

606
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,799
contacted me and that was from the very

607
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,520
beginning the first first uh year second

608
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,159
year. And so then that started a whole

609
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,159
thing. So everybody in Greece knew me

610
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,039
already for years. And uh I had gone to

611
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,720
Greece a few times. I had visited. I

612
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,520
went as I said I went to the services. I

613
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,039
was there for the 40-day memorial

614
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,159
service of Archbishop Chrisosimos. I

615
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,640
happened to be in Greece.

616
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,840
They were very respectful. The

617
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,799
archbishop was Yeah. I made a full bow

618
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,320
to him and uh they were uh they they

619
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,720
permitted me to be in the sanctuary.

620
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,679
>> Mhm.

621
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,880
>> And uh because you know they also sort

622
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,919
of saw where this was leading. They they

623
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,480
had you know we it's not like we were

624
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,240
throwing tomatoes at each other

625
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,480
>> anymore like they were in previous

626
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,559
generations.

627
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,159
>> And uh so that was uh Yeah. So then, so

628
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,679
when I went to Greece, then it was like

629
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,000
I wasn't I wasn't a stranger to them.

630
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,679
They knew who I was. So I was accepted

631
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,559
and I was made a bishop. Uh I was a

632
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,120
bishop of Toronto.

633
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,880
Sorry, bishop of uh Boston.

634
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,799
Born in Toronto, bishop of Toron. I

635
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,000
don't want to be bishop of Toronto

636
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
anyway. Metropolitan Moses is there.

637
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,000
>> Yeah.

638
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,880
>> So that So then what did what year did

639
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,559
you made the Metropolitan? how that go

640
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,559
about your main metropolitan of the

641
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,240
metropolis in America.

642
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,279
>> So yes, so 2010 we had that decision of

643
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,200
uh in HNA to recognize Archishop

644
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,799
Kalinos. 2012 I joined the Senate and I

645
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,960
was made bishop of uh Boston and then um

646
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,520
2014

647
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,840
uh Metropolitan Paul of Atoria who was

648
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,640
still acting met as Metropolitan who was

649
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,559
in a wheelchair and you know he is in a

650
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,720
wheelchair and it's just he can't really

651
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,720
fulfill his function uh as he could not

652
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,600
fulfill his conunction his uh function

653
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,400
as a bishop of the

654
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,919
Atoria Metropolitan and so what happened

655
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,480
was he resigned and then they voted me

656
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,440
in. Um there was a vote in Greece and I

657
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,559
became the Metropolitan of America.

658
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,240
Seems like since then your your whole

659
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,400
your whole uh goal is is unity of the

660
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,679
church now because it's now

661
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,000
you know it's funny because the people

662
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,679
are always you know we got the world

663
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,360
orthodox so it's all there's factions

664
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,919
everywhere but it seems like under your

665
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,720
>> your episcopacy you really united the

666
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,240
old calendars in America pretty

667
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,840
significantly.

668
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,240
>> Yeah. Well, as I said, I I started off

669
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,440
very early with that theme of uh saying

670
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,240
that the unity of the church is a dogma.

671
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,360
And um and that, you know, cuz what I

672
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,279
kept hearing was we're fine as we are.

673
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,279
There's this Protestant ecclesiology

674
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,200
where it's like we can be little groups

675
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,559
here and there. I don't really believe

676
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,200
that. I don't think it's it's right.

677
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,480
>> I understand that there could be some

678
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,799
economia, but that's not the norm.

679
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,840
>> Yeah.

680
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,440
Um

681
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,240
and so the whole idea was that uh yeah I

682
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,559
became when I came it was it wasn't

683
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,960
really much it was just a few you know

684
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,559
very Greek parishes

685
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,159
>> with the exception of father Thomas

686
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,159
Moretta in the wiggo um I think that was

687
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,960
sort of like more you know the American

688
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,039
style convert parish

689
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,919
>> and then we brought in 80 to 90% of

690
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,000
people from hagna

691
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,720
>> and um I was I was just a suffic bishop

692
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,159
at the time. But thank God um

693
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,559
you know most people recognized the

694
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,320
whole the whole purpose of what I was

695
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
trying to say

696
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
uh in terms of trying to be united to

697
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,799
the church and not fight the unity of

698
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,799
the church. And by the way, that's what

699
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,200
Elder Joikim wrote to me, you know, and

700
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,919
he's Elder Joikim was a real monastic,

701
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,919
you know, you don't

702
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,640
a monastic doesn't speak against another

703
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,360
elder, but there was this agreement,

704
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,600
this agreement, not disagreement, where

705
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,279
father uh Isaac, the abbot of the

706
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,799
monastery in Boston, actually permitted

707
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,799
me to write, tell the joke while I was

708
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,720
in Boston. So I kept writing and I would

709
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,399
write my confessions and things like

710
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,279
that.

711
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,240
>> Mhm. and he wrote and he said, you know,

712
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,720
it was like he was my other elder and he

713
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,799
said, um um tell Father Palmo over there

714
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,720
that uh he's supposed to be working for

715
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,919
the unity of the church. He's not

716
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,919
supposed to disunite the church,

717
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,840
>> which is, you know, it's a big no no for

718
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,440
one elder to speak against another elder

719
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,279
type thing, right? But this is matters

720
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,159
of faith

721
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,840
>> and this is when we're talking about the

722
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,720
unity of the church.

723
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,480
So uh as I said you know I um for me

724
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,919
Elder Join was is a saint

725
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,159
uh and um you know his his voice is is

726
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,080
very strong and carries very serious

727
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
weight.

728
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,159
So uh

729
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,440
yeah,

730
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,840
>> so

731
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,960
>> it's a well it's it's seems like

732
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,279
successful because we're now you know

733
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,200
the most centralized and biggest and the

734
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,720
stability in the GOC in America has been

735
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,399
it's not like what other people think

736
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,840
that you know oh there's factions

737
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,000
everywhere and what there's not

738
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,760
>> just take a look at

739
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,360
>> as I said you know search and you shall

740
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,360
find it there's good faith there's bad

741
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,640
faith there's people that are searching

742
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,760
there's people that aren't searching

743
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,200
people that are that put themselves in

744
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,399
position of fighting the church without

745
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,480
even realizing it. And we should fear

746
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,679
God

747
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,000
>> and so we have you have all these you

748
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,480
know we had I became metropolitan and

749
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,080
yes we did have people coming in from

750
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,840
different uh these different split

751
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,320
groups and we have plenty of uh people

752
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
which follow the Russian tradition some

753
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,919
the Greek tradition we have you know

754
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,200
convert parishes and uh

755
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,840
and uh that's the main thing is that uh

756
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,240
we we preserve our holy faith and be

757
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,159
united. So if you take a look at the

758
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,679
map,

759
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,919
um these splinter groups, I'm calling

760
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,600
them splinter groups, they hardly have

761
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,559
anybody. And even if you look at some of

762
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,039
their uh websites, they might have, you

763
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,320
know, a number of different churches.

764
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,840
But I know for a fact some of those

765
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,480
little parishes are little parishes with

766
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,840
like two or three people.

767
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,600
>> Two or three people.

768
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,559
>> Mhm.

769
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,360
>> There's no comparison. If anybody knows

770
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,799
anything about, you know, the GOC,

771
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,159
they'll know. They'll take a look at

772
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,600
that map, like I said, and it's like,

773
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,960
you know, there churches spreading out

774
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,039
everywhere. We're growing and we I

775
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,559
accepted a church and now we're starting

776
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,760
a mission in in North Carolina and uh

777
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,640
Louisiana and uh people here and there

778
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
are converting.

779
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,200
>> Yeah.

780
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,000
>> So, thank God.

781
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,039
>> Yeah. Yeah. I get I get a decent amount

782
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,640
of messages. I can only imagine what you

783
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,679
get.

784
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,600
>> Yeah. So that's awesome

785
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,000
>> that uh you know when it comes this

786
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,520
fighting against the church that brings

787
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,120
me to the the other issue I want to

788
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,880
bring up about in world orthodoxy is

789
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,960
this whole ecclesiological heresy or

790
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,360
error that's um that's being pushed by

791
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,600
lots of these you know influential

792
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,840
YouTubers these orthob bro youtubers is

793
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,200
the you know I call it the

794
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,960
ecclesiological heresy of the resist

795
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,000
within movement where they're you know

796
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,399
they're saying oh you you go are

797
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,840
schismatic and you're zealous not

798
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,960
according to knowledge and that you must

799
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,520
you must as a as a matter of doctrinal

800
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,120
faith that you must stay in communion

801
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,320
with a a heretic bishop. Can you talk

802
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,399
about that a bit like why where is

803
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,240
>> where have you where have we found such

804
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,760
a thing in the history of the church? I

805
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,240
I don't this new thing of you have to

806
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,480
wait for an ecumenical council when we

807
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,799
see on mass you know some very serious

808
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,720
stuff going on like very serious not one

809
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,760
or two people not one or two bishops but

810
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,600
you know no one really protesting

811
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,760
um when we see this type of thing you

812
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,760
know as I I mentioned to you earlier

813
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,039
there's the particular judgment and

814
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,519
there's the there's the general uh

815
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,279
judgment

816
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,880
Um

817
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,000
those who are already in heresy and who

818
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,159
preach it

819
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,720
are uh condemned. That's what this is

820
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,559
not my words. This is not what I'm

821
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,080
saying. This is what we find in all the

822
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,919
teachings of the fathers. They say run

823
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,080
away. They don't say run to.

824
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,600
>> It's unbelievable. It's really

825
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,039
unbelievable.

826
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,360
>> And you know as I said to you earlier

827
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,519
St. Isaac the Syrian St. Iserian says

828
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,200
don't even read the writings of

829
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,000
heretics. How much more should we not

830
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,799
pray uh with heretics? Because he says

831
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,720
it darkens the mind.

832
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,679
>> Mhm.

833
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,399
>> And so uh St. um Ignatius says it's uh

834
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,799
when heresy enters in, it's like it's

835
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,200
like uh mingling poison with Christ. Uh

836
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,799
putting some type of poison in the

837
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,440
sweetest of wines.

838
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,679
And and he says without recognizing it,

839
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,080
you've taken in this poison. And then

840
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,519
you know what happens? The fathers teach

841
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,480
us concerning u

842
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,320
uh indifference. We become indifferent

843
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
when we get deeply into some type of

844
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,840
sin. Well, the same thing happens here.

845
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,080
When you partake when you partaken of

846
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,000
this poison,

847
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,559
you don't really recognize it as poison.

848
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,159
And sometimes you can interpret it as

849
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,760
grace even.

850
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,960
>> And it's uh it's a fearful thing because

851
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,159
it's not like we're saying anything

852
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,840
different. And I want to stress again

853
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,679
that we haven't done any we haven't

854
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,080
moved. you know, we were we were with

855
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,679
>> Roor

856
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,679
>> and um the Rokor, you know, recognized

857
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,200
us and um there's a disagreement that we

858
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,559
had with the Roker, which went and

859
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,320
joined the Moscow patriarch. The the

860
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,559
disagreement is that um you're not

861
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,080
following through with what you said for

862
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,480
decades you were going to do if you were

863
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,799
to reunite with Moscow.

864
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:35,919
>> Yeah.

865
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,440
>> So,

866
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,960
what's the problem? as one of their

867
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,279
bishops, you know who who belongs to the

868
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,840
Roore MP said, you know what happened?

869
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,919
When did they become unconical like

870
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,720
overnight when we joined Moscow?

871
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,240
>> Mhm.

872
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,760
>> Even though, you know, there are,

873
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,640
believe it or not, there are some

874
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,440
bishops in the Moscow patriarchy that

875
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,440
have been saying things like we need to

876
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,640
unite with the gold counters.

877
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,600
But in any case, what the the big point

878
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,679
like I mentioned you before and I've

879
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,600
mentioned not too long ago in one of my

880
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,919
sermons is that

881
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,240
uh when St. Phil says I believe that the

882
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,879
Moscow patriarch doesn't have grace and

883
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,839
he uh he says I don't force anybody to

884
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,720
to believe what I'm saying.

885
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,240
We have a major issue when you're

886
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,079
talking about not just KGB agents who

887
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,440
became bishops. people who were not

888
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,720
ordained bishop, people who were not

889
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,399
even baptized.

890
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,639
How is that canonical?

891
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,960
>> How how is that not a problem when you

892
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,240
have that bishop who actually wasn't

893
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,480
even baptized ordaining priests?

894
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
And so, you know, all we're saying is

895
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,560
let's have some serious repentance on

896
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,159
the part of the Moscow patriarchy and

897
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,320
fix this problem. What a wonderful thing

898
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,520
it would be if we were all in

899
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,879
convenient. But the thing is there's a

900
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,599
reason. It's not like we want to start

901
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,760
our own personal franchise and call it

902
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,040
the church.

903
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,359
>> Yeah.

904
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,280
>> Like some fringe groups do,

905
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,040
unfortunately.

906
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,320
Um we've been here all along, you know,

907
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,240
with the blessings of St. Chrisosamus

908
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,480
and and we have our seals of St. and St.

909
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,359
John the Newsgiver and a plethora of

910
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,880
other fathers and mothers who were who

911
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,000
were uh god-bearing people and who

912
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,280
passed on their blessings to us. There's

913
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,680
there are others that eventually will be

914
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,240
uh officially glorified

915
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,640
and you know there was St. Barthus of

916
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,960
Hios who prophesied

917
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,800
>> uh you should really you should find his

918
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,440
life. It's a really beautiful life. And

919
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,839
Hebrew P is just before 1900 I think.

920
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,680
And

921
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,000
um he actually told he prophesied he

922
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,400
said in 100 years from now I'll be

923
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,520
glorified on earth and uh our sin

924
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,040
glorified him.

925
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,359
>> Nobody else did. And that was written by

926
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,040
father Joim of the patriarchet of

927
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,200
Jerusalem who wrote his life who was a

928
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,160
hyotist from Hios because uh St. Barthen

929
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,599
is from Hios.

930
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,400
>> Mhm. So

931
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,000
he was one of the saints that was added

932
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,280
into the list of saints of our church.

933
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,839
>> Yeah, that's um

934
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,200
when you say that that uh like it's like

935
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,400
when I wrote that book, the history of

936
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,920
resistance, we don't find like as you

937
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,400
said, we don't find that. We don't that

938
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,920
there's nowhere in the scriptures,

939
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,680
nowhere in the fathers, the saints, the

940
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,599
cannons, the councils that says flee to

941
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,839
the heretic. It's always the opposite.

942
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,640
So

943
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,400
>> let's stress Nobody, nobody says, nobody

944
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,200
says stay with the heretics. Nobody.

945
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,280
They all say flee

946
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,640
>> except for the Neoathanites that we all

947
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,640
know, you know, the the five, you know,

948
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,920
that are they say flee to them for some

949
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,079
reason where everybody St. Paul and you

950
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,480
know to Peter, Jude,

951
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,640
>> Thessalonians, Galatians, it says, you

952
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,160
know, total opposite. But

953
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,760
>> well whether or not we should obey man

954
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,240
or obey God, you be the judge as it says

955
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,760
in scriptures.

956
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,119
>> Yeah. So that that the whole that the

957
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,320
other thing that falls within that whole

958
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,920
resist within movement that I've been

959
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,599
fighting against since you know since

960
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,480
you take me took me into the GOC 3 years

961
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,760
ago now it's been so fast is and it's

962
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,119
one of the things that you've touched on

963
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,040
in you know in conversations we've had

964
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,440
together is the the matter of antimins.

965
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,480
>> Yeah. and why that I don't think most

966
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,079
most ley and most people don't know

967
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,520
understand the significance of the

968
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,400
antimins the the license that you give

969
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,320
your priest to celebrate on your behalf.

970
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,240
Can you explain?

971
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,880
>> Well, this is part of the

972
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,480
>> ironically

973
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,800
uh some of those people that resist from

974
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,520
within movement don't understand certain

975
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,240
really basic um teachings concerning

976
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,720
ecclesiology. And one of them as I said

977
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,000
was St. standing nation of the

978
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,720
godbearer. All the fathers talk about

979
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,640
the bishop.

980
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,200
Um your relationship with the bishop is

981
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,480
reflects your relationship with God. As

982
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,040
I said, you know, um what a horrible

983
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,119
thing when people have such a horrible

984
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,400
relationship with your bishop. If you

985
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,839
don't like him, go somewhere else. Why

986
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,599
are you speaking against that bishop?

987
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,359
It's not good for you.

988
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,400
>> Um so St. Ignatius, you know, he doesn't

989
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,320
mince his words and he's very very clear

990
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,640
about that. And he talks about if the

991
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,400
congregation

992
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,200
is under the bishop, nothing can be done

993
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,119
without the bishop. And so that anti

994
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,800
meansion is specifically the sign

995
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,079
literally with the autograph of the

996
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,040
bishop of permission for the priest to

997
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,640
serve the divine liturgy which means the

998
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,079
priest serves on behalf of the bishop.

999
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,480
So you are you believe what your bishop

1000
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,800
believes. Basically this is not this is

1001
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,280
not you know it's basic stuff. Yeah.

1002
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,680
>> Um,

1003
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,880
sorry.

1004
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,960
>> Oh, yeah. So, yeah, because most people

1005
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,760
don't even know what an antimman is. The

1006
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,960
>> the mention,

1007
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,800
>> the antimention is consecrated. It's a

1008
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,640
it's a temple. It's the altar.

1009
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,160
>> It's consecrated by the bishop. Um,

1010
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,960
we sew in some uh holy relics of martyrs

1011
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,720
underneath it because the liturgy always

1012
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,000
took place over the relics of the

1013
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,560
martyrs. Um, there's a whole service of

1014
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,119
consecrating it. We put holy crism on it

1015
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,440
and then we uh read prayers and then you

1016
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,640
have the signature the bishop signs it

1017
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,760
uh which is basically the bishop's uh

1018
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,079
okay to serve on this uh antiiments. So

1019
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,079
it's it's the bishop's aunt mention it

1020
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,359
belongs to him. Mhm.

1021
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,960
>> So that's what I'm saying is that's a

1022
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,359
basic teaching of church ecclesiology

1023
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,760
that you're you're serving in the name

1024
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,560
of your bishop.

1025
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,680
>> So that priest is supposed to be so

1026
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,040
there's that weird

1027
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,960
>> he's supposed to be connected to he's

1028
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,240
supposed to be connected to the bishop

1029
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,119
like the strings are to the lera as St.

1030
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,079
Ignatius God bear says. So it's not

1031
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,240
normal. It's not normal to have a bad

1032
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,920
for a priest and a bishop to have a bad

1033
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,520
relationship with each other. That's not

1034
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,040
normal.

1035
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,920
>> Whereas you have the resis within thing

1036
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,119
where there are plenty of uh priests who

1037
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,480
simply don't like their bishops. They

1038
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,079
might not like you know they don't like

1039
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,320
what the bishop teaches and um

1040
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,880
as I said earlier you know it's it's um

1041
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,640
when we spoke before this uh it's um you

1042
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,560
know we don't judge people personally. I

1043
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,160
don't know God their hearts. God only

1044
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,839
knows their hearts and how things turn

1045
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,040
out for them.

1046
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,599
>> But um but this is not orthodox. That's

1047
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,119
just not the teaching of the Orthodox

1048
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,240
church.

1049
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,599
>> Yeah. What does it like what does it

1050
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,000
mean for a priest when he knowingly like

1051
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,359
when you you know at that point in the

1052
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,280
liturgy when you unfold the antimins and

1053
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,280
you see the the signature of the bishop

1054
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,599
and that priest knowingly serves with

1055
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,920
like this bishop you know say LP Leaf

1056
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,040
Foros this bishop is a heretic 100%

1057
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,960
without equivocation

1058
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,640
but I'm going to commemorate him anyway.

1059
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,720
How does that affect you know the

1060
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,319
congregation and the priests like you

1061
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,359
were saying prior to us going live?

1062
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,040
Well, if you believe that that person,

1063
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,560
your bishop is is in fact a heretic, you

1064
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,079
have a serious problem. And what's going

1065
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,240
on is your conscience is getting weaker

1066
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,400
and weaker to the point where it's like

1067
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,319
it's okay. But thankfully, there are

1068
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,160
people who have consciences. And that's

1069
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,640
one of the things that sort of drives

1070
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,920
them to uh to come. Sometimes they make

1071
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,200
it, sometimes they don't make it. I

1072
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,640
remember a case where someone a new

1073
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,480
calendar priest came to me and I I I was

1074
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,720
sort of just teasing him. I said, "What?

1075
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,480
Why are you here? is your bishop won't

1076
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,920
let you be Orthodox or something. And he

1077
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,480
says, "Yeah."

1078
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,200
>> Mhm.

1079
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,720
>> Actually, yeah. He won't he won't let me

1080
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,359
baptize properly. He won't let me uh

1081
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,440
>> He had a whole list.

1082
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:45,839
>> Wow.

1083
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,599
>> So, uh that's a problem. You know, it's

1084
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,640
that's not a normal relationship.

1085
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,400
>> Yeah. I remember that's exactly what

1086
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,760
happened when that's, you know, it's

1087
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,800
funny you mentioned that because that's

1088
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,000
exactly the email. I don't know if you

1089
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,680
remember three years ago, that's the

1090
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,520
that's the email you sent to me. You

1091
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,440
said, "What's the you just want to be

1092
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,000
Orthodox?" Well, then

1093
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,480
>> I guess it's a common question I ask.

1094
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,160
>> Yeah. Like you're not allowed to be

1095
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,280
Orthodox over there. I was like,

1096
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,400
apparently not.

1097
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,880
Yes. It

1098
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,800
that was one of the major things because

1099
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,160
that's, you know, it's it's start it

1100
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,359
seems like it's starting to quiet down

1101
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,040
now, but is Yeah, it's the it's the uh

1102
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,760
the idea.

1103
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,400
>> What do you mean? What's quieting?

1104
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:28,960
>> Go ahead.

1105
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,400
>> I'm sorry. What do you mean by quieting

1106
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,359
down? for it seems like the argument of

1107
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,960
the whole res ever since I came out with

1108
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,800
the history of resistance book that the

1109
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,880
argument of you know you have to you

1110
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,440
must stay in communion with your heretic

1111
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,040
bishops regardless of you know him you

1112
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,800
know just recently especially since I

1113
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,920
put out the uh this 2025 annual

1114
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,480
chronology of accuminism where it's 167

1115
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,400
pages of every single jurisdiction

1116
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,800
and every single action of you know you

1117
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,800
know these bishops and their their

1118
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,400
prayer praying with heresy, joint

1119
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,319
prayers, joint services, ecumenical

1120
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,880
services. So, it's kind of I think

1121
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,720
people are starting to recognize it a

1122
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,599
little more. But why uh

1123
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,240
>> unless they've been poisoned?

1124
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,960
>> Yeah. So yeah, that's one of the things

1125
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,800
is people few people people don't find

1126
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,400
that's one of the things that I was want

1127
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,359
to ask you about is people believe and

1128
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:24,800
part of this is part of the resist

1129
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,079
within movement thing is people think

1130
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,560
well I have a good traditional priest

1131
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,079
and I've been calling it Orthodox

1132
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,440
Presbyterianism. They're like well I

1133
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,960
have a good Orthodox priest and he's

1134
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,560
traditionalist so therefore it doesn't

1135
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,680
matter what the bishop does.

1136
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,040
>> Yeah. Well that's again it's not

1137
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,720
orthodox. I mean, I'm glad for you that

1138
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,240
your priest is traditional, but it's not

1139
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,800
enough. You know, he he has to he has to

1140
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,640
be connected to bishop. His conscience

1141
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,160
needs to become stronger. He needs to

1142
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,560
pray about it and who needs to uh

1143
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,040
>> you know, seriously think things through

1144
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,280
and study

1145
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,560
uh the methodology of the fathers. How

1146
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,680
did the fathers go ahead uh when they

1147
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,280
dealt with heresy? As I said, you're not

1148
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,000
going to find anybody saying um stay

1149
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,079
with heresy.

1150
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,160
So you got to understand why this is at

1151
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,000
the very least you'd expect that other

1152
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,880
side to be sympathetic towards you know

1153
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,720
the fathers do say

1154
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,119
>> to do what we're doing but you don't

1155
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,880
find that and I think as I said there's

1156
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,359
there's a real element of poison I think

1157
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,960
that they think that they're do maybe

1158
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,800
doing something good but u that's part

1159
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,640
of the delusion.

1160
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,319
Yeah, in the scriptures it's it's

1161
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,680
through all all throughout the the

1162
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,440
epistles we see that that's not the

1163
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,079
teaching of the fathers. And it seems it

1164
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,720
seems like they disregard the the weight

1165
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,000
and the authority of the scriptures

1166
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,319
themselves. Like you know St. Paul says

1167
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,720
if any other even if an angel comes from

1168
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,400
heaven depart, you know,

1169
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,319
>> right?

1170
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,680
>> Why do you think that is that they

1171
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,440
they're so dismissive of the scriptures

1172
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,000
themselves? I mean that these

1173
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,160
>> Well, I'm going back to what the fathers

1174
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,280
say. The fathers talk about this poison

1175
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,680
>> and I think it there's an issue of the

1176
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,079
weakening of the conscience and then

1177
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,800
there it goes from that ignoring

1178
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,280
weakening to delusion.

1179
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,480
>> Mhm.

1180
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,560
>> So God's grace can pull people out of

1181
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,160
there but out of that delusion but um

1182
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,319
you know there's uh there has to be some

1183
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,040
serious repentance going on.

1184
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,119
>> Yeah. And I I think that the devil the

1185
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,359
devil inspires certain people also to

1186
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,240
fight the church. Those people who are

1187
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,680
trying to preserve I think St. Nico

1188
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,359
says something about um it's even worse

1189
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,520
you know if you haven't let's say the

1190
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,839
person hasn't left a bishop. What makes

1191
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,680
matters even worse is that they're

1192
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,680
condemning the ones who did for the sake

1193
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,520
of the Orthodox faith.

1194
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,599
>> Mhm.

1195
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,760
>> Yeah. That's

1196
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,680
it's particularly that's interesting

1197
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,040
especially for a lot of because I know

1198
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,800
we've seen a lot of Roore MP people

1199
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,839
coming over to us. So it's

1200
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,079
>> that uh the whole anathema against

1201
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,240
humanism in the 1983 anathema that seems

1202
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,800
to people are recognizing because that

1203
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,880
video that is resurfacing of you know

1204
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,280
one of the bishops saying well what do

1205
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,920
we if we don't remove it we fall under

1206
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,920
our own anathema. So

1207
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,040
>> right

1208
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,200
>> is there's

1209
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,359
can people remove an anathema? Can a can

1210
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,160
a unification document renew re unh

1211
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,280
heresy a heresy? Is that how that works?

1212
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,280
>> Well as I said that's what makes us more

1213
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,359
continuers of roor

1214
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,720
>> in some ways because um we hold on to

1215
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,119
the decisions of roor and here in

1216
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,720
America you know we basically have two

1217
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,760
mother churches. it's roore and also the

1218
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,359
church in Greece

1219
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,000
>> which both both have a beautiful history

1220
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,760
and people don't realize that in Greece

1221
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,079
there's a major major history in terms

1222
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,560
of saints

1223
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,119
>> uh and and holy people who really fought

1224
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,560
the good fight and as I've said before

1225
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,359
I mean when you get poisoned

1226
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,119
even a huge miracle like the appearance

1227
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,520
of the cross in the sky in 1925 which

1228
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,119
verified for the faithful what they need

1229
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,599
to do even that's like nah

1230
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,520
Who cares?

1231
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,040
>> Why ignore that? I mean, you have it in

1232
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,920
the manan a couple times

1233
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,000
>> and it's in the manan, the appearance of

1234
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,800
the cross, and now we have this

1235
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,960
situation of the appearance of why why

1236
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,400
did it appear? We all know why it

1237
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,920
appeared.

1238
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,040
And we had 2,000 witnesses.

1239
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,880
And you know, it's I think it's demonic

1240
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,800
to just ignore that.

1241
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,480
>> Yeah.

1242
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,640
>> What would have happened? Wouldn't God

1243
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,000
have known that basically all those

1244
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,240
people would become true orthodox?

1245
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,839
>> You know, and then every 10 years they

1246
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,520
would have a reunion and just talk about

1247
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,240
it so that they don't wouldn't forget

1248
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,480
the uh significance of such a

1249
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,480
magnificent event. Um and they uh you

1250
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,440
know they just it was like anis the

1251
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,560
remembrances of of what they were deemed

1252
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,560
worthy to be a part of.

1253
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,119
>> Mhm. No one ever said, "Well, no, you

1254
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,280
know, maybe it was a star or, you know,

1255
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,960
maybe there were some clouds or maybe it

1256
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,400
was, you know, they was faced the wrong

1257
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,000
way." Nobody.

1258
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,680
>> Yeah.

1259
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,559
It's that's that event particularly, I

1260
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:23,920
don't know if you've I don't think I

1261
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,920
sent it to you, but that um event it was

1262
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,640
I think it was in the 19 you know the

1263
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,839
magazine Orthodox Life out of

1264
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,440
Jordanville,

1265
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,920
>> that old magazine. Yeah. They have a

1266
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,599
there's a whole issue dedicated there's

1267
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,040
a whole section of one of their orthodox

1268
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,960
life dedicated to that specific miracle

1269
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,440
which

1270
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:41,760
>> right

1271
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,440
>> show that they recognize it prior to

1272
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,480
2007.

1273
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,079
>> Have you ever heard such a miracle for

1274
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,160
sysmatics? Did the old believers have

1275
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,839
such a miracle? Do you hear anything

1276
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,440
like that anywhere?

1277
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,240
>> No. No.

1278
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,000
>> What are we talking about?

1279
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,839
>> Yeah.

1280
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:00,000
Yeah. That's that's just uh something

1281
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,599
else they try to pick apart. That's

1282
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,920
unfortunate. But

1283
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,280
it's um and for those who don't know the

1284
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,440
the story, you can go to my blog and

1285
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,119
there's I have the whole I have that

1286
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,680
whole story there and icon you can look

1287
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,400
at it. It's beautiful story.

1288
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,839
So the other thing I want to talk about

1289
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,480
that other people are actually really

1290
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,040
wondering because you know we have a

1291
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,880
because your YouTube channel's big and

1292
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,040
the GOC is growing is that uh these

1293
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,960
other true Orthodox senids we have you

1294
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,520
know people from all over the world

1295
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,440
other other cinnids and other

1296
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,599
jurisdictions that are you know you can

1297
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,280
classify as you know within the old

1298
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,319
calendar calendars. How do we how does

1299
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,359
the GOC how do we how do we approach

1300
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,240
that that top that subject? How do we

1301
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,359
see them? And

1302
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:50,240
>> I know it depends.

1303
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,800
>> Well well we we see ourselves as

1304
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,079
the continuers of the of the true

1305
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,520
Orthodox Church. That's why I said I

1306
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,720
don't accept GOCK. We are the GOC. And

1307
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,800
in fact there I I heard not too long ago

1308
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,400
but somebody from England who's

1309
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,880
well-known writer says you know I have

1310
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,920
to admit the goc is what roar used to be

1311
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,200
even though he's not in communion with

1312
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,400
us.

1313
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,079
>> Um

1314
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,720
and um I I think it's a disservice to

1315
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,240
the church when you have these side

1316
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,359
groups. I think that they need to do

1317
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,640
everything possible to come to us

1318
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,400
like I did. I mean I'm not speaking as

1319
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,599
somebody who was uh always in the GOC

1320
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,359
like I like I said I was in Roor and

1321
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,920
then you know I just followed my parish

1322
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,839
even though I continued even after they

1323
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,079
they left Rok I still went to the Roore

1324
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,920
church because I was um friends with the

1325
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,760
the the priest lived close to us and his

1326
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,359
son and I were friends you know so I

1327
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,920
would go to the church uh sometimes I

1328
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,079
served in the sanctuary

1329
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,960
um and Um,

1330
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,359
it's uh it it does a disservice to the

1331
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:58,720
church. I don't I think that they're

1332
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,559
lacking the understanding of unity in

1333
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,760
the church. I think they have their own

1334
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,400
type of poison. Uh I don't know how

1335
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,680
God's going to judge him. I'm not going

1336
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,240
to be the judge on this whole thing, but

1337
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,839
um

1338
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,440
they need to do everything possible to

1339
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,720
come into the unity of the church for

1340
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,400
the sake of the of the uh the good of

1341
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,640
the church. And on top of it, they need

1342
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,559
to be very careful because I think some

1343
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,160
of them are have put themselves in the

1344
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,839
position of fighting the church and

1345
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,640
there's no fear of God in that. It's and

1346
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,599
it's nitpicking nothing. It's like they

1347
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,119
don't they're indicating that they know

1348
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,920
nothing about the history of the church.

1349
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,200
And um you don't split over even

1350
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,880
canonical infractions unless they're

1351
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,319
matters of faith.

1352
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,359
>> Yeah.

1353
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,040
>> You know

1354
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,640
um and we're talking about things which

1355
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,079
aren't matters of faith. Then sometimes

1356
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,440
they try to bring in this whole thing of

1357
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,319
well oh these are matters of faith. Well

1358
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:51,839
I don't buy it because it's not matters

1359
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,559
of faith. Um, you know, Archerish

1360
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,720
Bentius, for example, right?

1361
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,920
>> Some of the ones that are trying to

1362
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,319
defend Archish Bentios.

1363
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,079
Um,

1364
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,160
>> in 1984, he wrote a thing praising

1365
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,119
Patriarch Diodoros of Jerusalem because

1366
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,280
Patriarch Deodoros loved the old

1367
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,480
counters.

1368
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,040
>> Mhm.

1369
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,280
>> And uh and he went to Phile, you

1370
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,880
remember that? You know, and um anyway

1371
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,280
um they sort of saw him as a different

1372
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,800
uh type of a patriarch. And then there

1373
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,280
was who came after him. And I remember

1374
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,640
all the old school.

1375
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,640
>> I was I came across something not too

1376
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,240
long ago with Jerusale. And it's like so

1377
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,240
sad because all the old school's gone. I

1378
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,319
remember I remember them very well. It

1379
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,319
was like there was for them was like no

1380
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,480
difference for I mean they they believe

1381
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,119
we were all uh part of the same church

1382
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,160
even though they were in communion with

1383
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,680
Constantinople. unfortunately, you know,

1384
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,960
whatever it was. But um

1385
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,359
>> um so Arishbakio, you know, he um

1386
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,920
I think everybody sort of loves him as a

1387
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,160
person, but uh he made some very serious

1388
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,800
mistakes and

1389
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,599
uh so they try to sort of gloss over all

1390
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,520
that and then it's like see what you did

1391
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,599
see is narcissistic behavioral patterns

1392
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,160
quite frankly to use modern terminology.

1393
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,280
Um but really deep down it's pheriseical

1394
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,240
and I think that there's a real danger

1395
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,839
uh because they have not come to

1396
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,760
recognize that we're talking about

1397
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,079
ecclesiology and matters of faith unity

1398
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,480
of the church is a dogma of the church.

1399
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,240
It's a dogma.

1400
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,000
>> And so you can't just start your own

1401
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,200
personal franchise and call it the

1402
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,800
church as I've said before.

1403
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,040
>> And then from a human perspective, it's

1404
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,040
like, well, we have to defend what is

1405
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,720
ours. But it's not your own personal

1406
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,440
franchise. And it's the body of Christ.

1407
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,359
>> The body of Christ is not yours to play

1408
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:42,160
with. It's it's Christ's. And Jesus

1409
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,400
Christ, the Lord wishes that we all be

1410
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,160
one.

1411
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,359
And so I think when I I I hear similar

1412
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,680
voices with all these fringe groups and

1413
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,440
there's certain behavioral patterns that

1414
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,520
are very similar

1415
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,119
and there's a darkness. It's it's

1416
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,040
there's there's not where's the love of

1417
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,720
Christ. I mean you have to have unity in

1418
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,319
Christ

1419
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,160
and the Christ is the one that wants all

1420
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,240
men to be saved.

1421
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,960
>> But sometimes it as I said when you work

1422
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,559
for the disunityity of the church we

1423
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:11,920
have a problem. And I told you what

1424
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,960
Elder Jokin wrote telling me, you know,

1425
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,640
you're supposed to be united. You're not

1426
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,040
supposed to be

1427
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,440
>> So I would I would even take the

1428
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,920
occasion to tell everybody return. Just

1429
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,760
come back. There's no reason why why

1430
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,920
there should be these fringe groups and

1431
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,680
think it's okay. It's Protestant.

1432
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,839
>> Yeah.

1433
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,119
>> Yeah. I was, you know, I'm looking at,

1434
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,640
you know, when I when I'm looking I

1435
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,319
think about a lot of the s those other

1436
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,760
jurisdictions and senators out there,

1437
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,720
they don't theologically, you know,

1438
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,839
we're pretty much on the same I think

1439
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,160
we're all on the same page primarily.

1440
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,920
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1441
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,079
>> Um,

1442
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,319
so what's what's their reason for being

1443
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:53,440
a part,

1444
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,160
>> right? And so, you know, I hope God's

1445
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,000
mercy comes on all of them. I I would

1446
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,400
like to think that in a way we have a

1447
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,280
certain commonality but the spirit is

1448
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,760
not it's not even the spirit of St.

1449
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,480
Ferret. I mean St. Ferrett was very

1450
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,319
adamant but you know I remember the

1451
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,559
parish priest from my uh parish in

1452
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,200
Toronto Father Pod he's still alive God

1453
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,599
bless him he's uh it's like 88 or

1454
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,119
something and God give him a good

1455
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,119
Christian ending and remember all his

1456
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,599
good works. Uh what happened with Father

1457
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,400
Ponyotis was that um he went to

1458
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,280
Jordanville and he took his he was he

1459
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,400
was like really close to Archer ship uh

1460
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,319
what's his name before um Yakovos he was

1461
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,640
he was sort of like an adopted son in a

1462
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,920
way you know because he was an orphan

1463
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,400
boy he lost his father and so he was

1464
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,960
close with uh with Bishop Yakos but he

1465
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,319
put everything on the line for the sake

1466
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,839
of the truth and he made an announcement

1467
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,000
at his new counter parish saying that

1468
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,359
I'm going to leave. And unfortunately,

1469
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:55,119
the man that we call our bishop is a

1470
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,799
heretic. Just straight out like that.

1471
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,880
And the last liturgy that he had there,

1472
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,640
I think his last liturgy was St. Tyres

1473
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,799
the new calendar. Then he he started the

1474
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,839
church of St. Tyres, the old calendar.

1475
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:08,079
And um

1476
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,720
so he took a group of people. They

1477
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,240
started off with like 11 people, I

1478
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,359
think, and he thought, you know, we're

1479
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:14,400
not going to have anybody. We're just

1480
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,599
going to be a small little group of

1481
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,119
people. They ended up getting 500

1482
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,520
families. And Sydney Tyrus himself would

1483
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,599
appear to people and say, "Go to my

1484
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:22,640
church." Some of these people didn't

1485
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,000
even know who he was at the time. And um

1486
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,839
and then what happened was that uh he

1487
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,400
took a bus of people to Jordanville and

1488
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,640
he was a new counter's priest and

1489
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,839
Valikica Verki you know who was very um

1490
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,119
strong in his language against

1491
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,880
accummitism and who was another you know

1492
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,720
holy man um took him in with with a

1493
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,480
great deal of love and put him into the

1494
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,920
sanctuary and um prayed with him and Fod

1495
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,280
says if he hadn't done that it would

1496
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,400
have been more difficult for us to join

1497
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,760
So you know there's the pastoral

1498
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,119
approach there's what's written on the

1499
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,640
paper but then there's the pastoral

1500
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,040
approach and St. Phillard himself I can

1501
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,359
tell you from clergy that we have he

1502
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,599
really applied a lot of economia and

1503
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,440
pastoral care in many different

1504
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,520
circumstances with the intention of

1505
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,720
helping people to embrace orthodoxy as

1506
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,680
we know it as it should be.

1507
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,799
So um that's something else to to take

1508
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:23,359
into consideration. Um, so it's it comes

1509
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:25,839
down to the spirit of the law and the

1510
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,480
letter of the law. Uh, God wants all men

1511
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,920
to be saved. But, um, so I don't know

1512
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,839
how God's going to judge any of these

1513
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:35,040
French group. We don't know how God's

1514
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,480
going to judge anybody because the end

1515
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,839
it's his it's his call.

1516
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,200
But we're commanded to follow the

1517
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,119
teachings of the fathers.

1518
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:45,680
>> That's the main thing for us. And uh,

1519
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,520
and if we read all the ancient fathers,

1520
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,760
we'll find that uh, the unity of the

1521
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,200
church is important. and without any

1522
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,799
emperor

1523
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,799
um you know we don't have an emperor to

1524
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:57,359
help us it's still abundantly clear as

1525
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:58,799
far as I'm concerned it's abundantly

1526
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,720
clear just take a look at the map of

1527
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,319
America

1528
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,000
>> that our senate is really the

1529
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,839
continuation

1530
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:08,839
>> yeah

1531
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,319
so the going back that that also reminds

1532
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:13,920
me that's what what this with these

1533
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,079
other sin is they one of the the

1534
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,079
barriers that you know that's constantly

1535
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,960
constantly being brought up is oh

1536
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,720
cyprianism cyprianism how do we it's

1537
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,880
endless it's like it's just an endless

1538
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,960
oh cypriion cypriite it's just like with

1539
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,280
the with the drum of cyprianism can you

1540
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,000
can you shut that argument down for

1541
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,480
>> well I think it's another one of those

1542
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,079
unenlightened

1543
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:41,040
things of

1544
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,720
I don't know feeling better for yourself

1545
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,960
with with what you are you know your

1546
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,799
whether you're a systematic group or

1547
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,520
whether there could be some type

1548
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,559
um even if there were some type of

1549
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,559
legitimacy, let's say, because I I can't

1550
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,640
really speak for most of the Russian

1551
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,799
um jurisdictions except for the fact

1552
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,280
that we have what we believe to be the

1553
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,040
canonical ro.

1554
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:05,680
>> Mhm.

1555
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,599
>> Um you know, there's the roach and

1556
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,520
there's some

1557
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,720
uh but I have a lot of reservations,

1558
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,319
especially with what's going on here in

1559
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:15,680
America. Mhm.

1560
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,720
>> Um there's only like one bishop in half

1561
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,400
a parish or maybe one parish. I don't

1562
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,319
know. Two parishes maybe. I don't know.

1563
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,040
But any case um

1564
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,760
uh

1565
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,200
the super they so there's a lot of

1566
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,280
information here. I don't want to I

1567
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,000
don't want to go on and on, but

1568
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,079
it it was a victory of Orthodoxy when

1569
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,640
our churches were united.

1570
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,839
And um you know, they're not supernites

1571
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:47,359
anymore. And the irony is that some of

1572
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:49,680
these Russian groups who were in

1573
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,440
communion with the supernites when the

1574
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,680
superites were cypriites are now

1575
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,079
pointing fingers at us even though the

1576
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,960
supernites humbly came to our church.

1577
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,520
like I I remember Metropolitan uh

1578
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,599
Cyprien

1579
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,880
um Jr. together with Bishop Clement and

1580
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,079
Bishop Oxentius in Greece

1581
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,119
at the moment of of you know the union

1582
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,799
uh they took off their engula and they

1583
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,040
asked for prayer of forgiveness and in a

1584
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:22,000
humble way they came into our sin and

1585
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,040
actually the first sin meeting together

1586
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,839
uh with them was the the acceptance of

1587
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:29,359
my

1588
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,319
metropolitan uh title as Metropolitan of

1589
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,559
America after we were united. That was

1590
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,640
the first the first ecclesiastical act

1591
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,559
we did which I mean I consider it a

1592
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,400
blessing because

1593
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,839
because we're talking about the unity of

1594
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,920
the church and I think people don't

1595
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,520
understand that basic teaching again

1596
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,319
it's it's it's a dogma

1597
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,799
>> and so there's no such thing as

1598
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,319
cyprinism

1599
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,160
um

1600
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,880
>> you know I don't there when you have

1601
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,319
thousands and thousands of people people

1602
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,000
may have certain opinions about certain

1603
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,160
things but the teachings that we have

1604
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,520
the official teaching of our church is

1605
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:07,280
what is the main thing um is uh you know

1606
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,240
what we've been teaching all along.

1607
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,680
>> Yeah. I remember when I did the

1608
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,359
interview with the Metropolitan Oxentios

1609
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:17,119
and we covered this it was he made it he

1610
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,440
made the particular point that even

1611
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,839
among the the former cinnid resistance

1612
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,040
that wasn't a doctrinal

1613
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,799
belief that was being promulgated. It

1614
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:29,280
was according to Metropol Bishop Oentios

1615
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,400
it was

1616
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,559
>> his

1617
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:34,799
yeah yeah it was his hermenetics and it

1618
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:36,319
was something you know meant for

1619
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:38,559
dialogue and

1620
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,480
ideas being thrown around not it wasn't

1621
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,319
necessarily

1622
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,400
>> um a doctrinal thing that they were

1623
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,880
promulgating is and um

1624
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,400
>> that's what we heard from them when they

1625
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,680
came to us. Yeah. Mhm.

1626
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,240
And so I think and it's interesting is

1627
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,839
that those people the same people like

1628
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,520
that are throwing that cypriism thing

1629
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,559
around. It's like they're trying to

1630
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,079
throw that on the GOC. It was like well

1631
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:03,200
that the GOC actually itself had

1632
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,480
absolutely nothing to do with that

1633
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,799
originally. Am I correct?

1634
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:08,960
>> Yeah. So I mean we're talking about just

1635
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,599
a handful of people probably anyway. But

1636
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:12,480
um

1637
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,000
>> sometimes those handful of people like

1638
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,520
to really really shout

1639
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,760
>> Yeah. I mean, we're like I said, we're

1640
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,760
the overwhelming majority without an

1641
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,119
emperor.

1642
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:23,839
>> Yeah.

1643
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,079
>> And um

1644
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,319
it's, you know, we embrace they're

1645
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:29,839
they're a beautiful addition to our

1646
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:31,200
>> Senate.

1647
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,520
>> Beautiful addition to our

1648
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,240
um you know, they have a spiritual

1649
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:40,720
backbone. They're um educated. They um

1650
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,280
they love the church.

1651
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,839
So, for me, this was a victory of

1652
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,359
Orthodoxy.

1653
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:50,319
Yeah. Yeah. I think I think that's just

1654
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,559
kind of a Yeah. Because that issue

1655
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:53,920
always gets drummed up and it's I think

1656
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,599
it's just a it's a dead issue. But

1657
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,760
people, you know, the hand

1658
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,680
it's the Pharisee trying to justify his

1659
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,000
position. There's nothing there.

1660
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,319
>> Yeah.

1661
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:03,680
>> How can you and and a lot of these

1662
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,280
people consider, you know, Roor

1663
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,640
canonical, how can you consider Ro

1664
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,040
canonical? They were their soldiers even

1665
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,599
more ambiguous in some ways

1666
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:15,400
>> than the superns.

1667
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,359
Yeah, they were very uh they didn't want

1668
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,119
Yeah, Roore itself didn't want to didn't

1669
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:23,039
want to be definitive,

1670
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,599
>> right?

1671
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,280
>> So, you mentioned that you know you

1672
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,200
mentioned Rowak in America and we just

1673
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:33,280
uh can you tell us about the new parish

1674
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,920
and uh they took in

1675
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,720
>> Oh, that's a the parish of St. Peter the

1676
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,079
Alute. I think it was the only real

1677
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,240
parish they had.

1678
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,520
>> Yeah. But

1679
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,960
>> to the credit of the priest, he

1680
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,400
basically believed what I'm saying that

1681
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,559
we have we have to understand that the

1682
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,160
church needs to be united. And uh his

1683
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,480
conscience pangs probably went sky

1684
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,400
probably skyrocketed when he heard his

1685
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,240
bishop saying we're the only left, you

1686
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,160
know, the last remnant or something,

1687
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,760
which is what a lot of these French

1688
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,039
groups say.

1689
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,559
>> And they have nothing to show for it

1690
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:10,799
really. And um

1691
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:12,559
there's this idea of we're comfortable

1692
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:15,760
as we are. It's like I said the personal

1693
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,240
franchise type thing and there has to be

1694
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,400
some type of um validation.

1695
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,720
And so you know it it follows that you

1696
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,559
say

1697
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,880
that uh the person or the the group that

1698
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,000
or the church that threatens you

1699
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,400
um you know you feel threatened so you

1700
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,680
have to come up with your fair cycle. uh

1701
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,119
>> bombs that you want to throw back at

1702
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,240
them which are totally just I'm just

1703
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,240
gonna say totally stupid.

1704
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:44,559
>> Yeah.

1705
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,240
>> You know there's no this is not the

1706
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,680
enlightened Louis this is not the

1707
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,359
enlightened mind who talks about these

1708
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:50,720
things.

1709
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,440
>> How do how do we reach out because I had

1710
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,520
the question posed to me this this last

1711
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,359
uh on Christmas actually is whose

1712
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:02,400
responsibility is it? is it ours that we

1713
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,319
re start you know knocking on their door

1714
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:07,039
and I know that happened and it happens

1715
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,319
in cases but for my my train of thought

1716
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:15,680
is like as you said we are the GOC and

1717
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,680
they need to come to us and it's not not

1718
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,359
necessarily the other way around if and

1719
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,440
we can't force them to come if they

1720
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,200
don't want

1721
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,880
>> well I have no problem reaching out to

1722
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,839
anybody that I think has is hopeful but

1723
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:29,440
when I'm pretty clear that it's not

1724
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,799
hopeful

1725
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:33,119
Um, and I and I think that it's actually

1726
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,440
going to be poisonous for we have

1727
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,000
something good going, glory to God. Um,

1728
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,920
if I if I see that there's not going to

1729
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,160
be any type of repentance, which you

1730
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,680
know, I strongly believe because I went

1731
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,200
through repentance

1732
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,920
>> and then we have a problem. And like for

1733
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,599
example, we did have an unofficial

1734
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,760
dialogue with the main Matthew group,

1735
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,640
right?

1736
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,440
>> Yeah.

1737
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,000
>> And they're much more balanced than as

1738
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,240
far as I'm concerned. I I haven't to be

1739
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,599
fair I haven't really looked into all

1740
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:04,799
these other Matthew groups but um

1741
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:06,640
the holy food for Christ sake so talked

1742
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,480
me out of

1743
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,000
being close to because I was I was so

1744
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,240
amazed by the order of the Matthews at

1745
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,720
that time 1988 they had the largest

1746
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,119
convent largest monaster in Gree 400

1747
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:20,319
nuns

1748
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,240
>> and they had magnificent services and

1749
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,559
you know archbishop I knew all the

1750
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:26,960
bishops of the Matthews by the time I 12

1751
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,200
13 as I said the floor nights you know

1752
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,079
and um the Matthewites in some ways even

1753
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:33,839
had more order back then but now it's

1754
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,000
exact opposite

1755
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,720
>> and um so we had a sort of an unofficial

1756
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,640
dialogue and it's the usual Matthew

1757
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,880
White stuff you can't even talk

1758
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,559
>> they won't accept St. John of course

1759
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,359
they won't never accept Stillerette

1760
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:52,799
um you know this is

1761
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,799
uh we have to admit that St. Cruso must

1762
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:55,839
have made a mistake. I already know

1763
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:57,920
these things. So, how are we going to

1764
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,000
discuss it? There's never there's no

1765
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,520
this we're not getting anywhere with

1766
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,720
that.

1767
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,440
>> Yeah.

1768
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,400
>> Uh but the others, you know, um I got a

1769
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,960
phone call once a long time ago from um

1770
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,640
I get messages from Greece and from

1771
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,760
people that from different places to um

1772
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,520
I had a phone call from Bishop, one of

1773
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,319
the fringe groups in um

1774
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,240
in England.

1775
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,839
>> Mhm. and um he was very friendly and he

1776
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:27,200
wanted I think he just wanted to uh

1777
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,280
establish contact but I was actually

1778
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,039
more

1779
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:33,520
blunt than I think I've ever been

1780
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,640
because I was because I was I just said

1781
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,960
I'm here because I believe that this is

1782
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,799
this is the truth. this is the church of

1783
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,960
the GOC and u

1784
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,839
>> I don't you know years ago when I wasn't

1785
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,720
in the GOC I did believe well there's

1786
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,480
you know I had more sympathies

1787
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,079
especially after having seen like what I

1788
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:54,240
said on Malathos but it was basically

1789
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,400
accentiosimos

1790
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,720
thing and there were some conselbrations

1791
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,400
going on

1792
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,119
but um

1793
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,559
um you know it just now everything is

1794
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,079
just abundantly clear as far as I'm

1795
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:10,000
concerned and the the vision bishop who

1796
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
called me said it himself. He said,

1797
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,960
"Yeah, I think your sin is the real main

1798
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,080
sin."

1799
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,120
>> Mhm.

1800
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,960
>> So,

1801
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,199
um I think that when you establish that

1802
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:23,440
point, when you come to understand that

1803
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,759
point, that means that um you have the

1804
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:28,799
responsibility to uh to do everything

1805
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,440
possible to come. Now, I as I said, I'm

1806
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,159
open to talking to people if I see that

1807
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:36,640
there's hope, but I think that there's a

1808
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,000
lot of poison going around. There's a

1809
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,759
lot of temptation for the right stuff

1810
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:42,560
that's too off and that could be very

1811
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,560
poisonous for the good that we have

1812
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,679
here.

1813
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:46,400
>> Yeah,

1814
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,440
>> I strongly believe in repentance.

1815
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,600
>> Yeah, that's if anybody's ever watched

1816
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,520
your your homalies on

1817
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,359
>> Yes, I talk about

1818
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:57,920
>> all day. That's it's I think that's one

1819
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,759
of the attractions that people is have

1820
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:03,759
toward um the GOC in general and the

1821
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:05,199
especially your homalies that you post

1822
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:07,600
on on your channel at Orthodox Tradition

1823
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,239
is it's it's not you know we're always

1824
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:11,920
accused of this oh the zealots without

1825
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,359
knowledge the zealots on the right when

1826
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,480
it's actually no that's not actually the

1827
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,440
case for us

1828
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,679
>> I mean I talk about temptation on the

1829
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,120
right I've talked about it many times in

1830
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,040
some of the sermons it is a danger is a

1831
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,799
danger Yeah.

1832
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:27,279
>> Yeah.

1833
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:29,040
>> I remember when I was personally dealing

1834
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,759
with it when I was in Boston and I and I

1835
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,199
was in the library and I said, "Okay,

1836
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:35,199
wait. Let's see what the enemy has to

1837
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:36,640
say." And I didn't even know much about

1838
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,159
him because I went when I was 19. The

1839
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:40,319
enemy was Father Sarah Rose. And I

1840
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:41,920
opened it up. I opened up his book just

1841
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,319
randomly and it was like exactly what my

1842
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,920
thoughts were, exactly what I was going

1843
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,759
through at the time.

1844
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,799
>> And and it was like, "Wow, this is very

1845
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:51,920
clear."

1846
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,800
>> Mhm. So, you know, of course, time has

1847
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,800
passed uh from then to now, and I think

1848
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,760
things are solidifying, but

1849
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,840
uh to be fair, you know, there have been

1850
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,280
plenty of times in the history of the

1851
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,280
church when miraculously everything just

1852
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,880
gets back to normal. But I think it's

1853
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,920
very clear that we're we're not like

1854
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,400
we're not in the best times.

1855
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,560
We're getting closer and closer to the

1856
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,440
end. And that's just a fact. You know,

1857
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,400
time passes, you get closer to the end.

1858
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,840
And there's a lot of demons around

1859
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,960
there.

1860
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,000
>> Yeah, that that's uh brings me to the

1861
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,600
question is you know like as we all know

1862
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,520
the panh heresy of accuminism is

1863
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,040
advancing more rapidly now than at any

1864
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,360
point in the recent past. It's it's just

1865
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,640
exponentially now we have you know uh

1866
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,719
bishops like LP the fora sending his

1867
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,960
vicar bishops to go pray with Hindus and

1868
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,800
you know the Serbians lighting manoras

1869
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,159
and the Serbians celebrating you know in

1870
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:51,679
essence conselbrating with the the

1871
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:54,400
monophosites and it's just it's on and

1872
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,040
on and on and on for the what do you say

1873
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,480
to the or again the Moscow patriarchy or

1874
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,199
you know um just recently the pope and

1875
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,520
the pope in Bartholomew doing that whole

1876
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,400
na thing. What do you tell to the people

1877
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,800
at uh like the lay people in in these

1878
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,320
world orthodox jurisdictions, the

1879
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,520
communist jurisdictions like who say

1880
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,840
like you know when is enough enough?

1881
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,920
>> Yeah. I think the major temptation I

1882
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,199
think that's being thrown at everybody

1883
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,920
is we still have not taken communion at

1884
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,560
the common chalice. But again in the

1885
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,880
history of the church you never find

1886
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,800
such

1887
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,600
uh official

1888
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,880
union in the way that we find it today.

1889
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,520
where you have you have sister churches.

1890
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:41,840
>> Yeah,

1891
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,199
>> they're calling each other. They're

1892
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:44,800
calling each other sister churches.

1893
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,880
Constantinople and and Rome. Um and as I

1894
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,560
said, you know, if you don't like that,

1895
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,679
then find someone else, you know.

1896
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,920
>> Um a lot of people don't like but but

1897
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,320
what kind of a statement is that for the

1898
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,280
center of orthodoxy, Constantinople? Um

1899
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,159
he received the pope. They received the

1900
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,480
pope with the bells as you would

1901
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,320
normally receive a bishop.

1902
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,520
>> Mhm.

1903
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,440
>> Um he was uh received with a sensor with

1904
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:17,360
the candles, the episcopal candles.

1905
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,840
And he was commemorated before patriarch

1906
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,239
Bartholomew was.

1907
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:23,840
And you know what happened is some of

1908
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,360
the conservatives saying, "Oh, well now

1909
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:28,960
just another the usual stuff." What

1910
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,760
>> the usual stuff?

1911
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,520
This is major. And some other people are

1912
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,040
saying things like ah who cares about

1913
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,199
the decisions? What

1914
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,840
>> since when I mean orthodox you always we

1915
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,360
depend on decisions. That's the voice of

1916
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,280
the church. That's when bishops get

1917
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,840
together and make decisions. That's the

1918
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,159
voice of your sinnod your bishops. I

1919
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:49,920
mean it's serious. No no no we'll just

1920
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,159
ignore that. Go down to ecumenical

1921
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,920
council. Something's wrong. I mean this

1922
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,159
is what I'm saying about the poison.

1923
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:56,480
>> Mhm.

1924
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,320
>> It's it should be abundantly clear but

1925
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,520
it's not abundantly clear. And I think

1926
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,880
there's a lot of emotions involved. you

1927
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,000
have family and you have this and you

1928
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,719
have that. It's not so easy. Clergy, the

1929
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,199
one I mentioned the one clergyman that

1930
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:09,600
almost joined us. Uh his concern was

1931
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,719
money.

1932
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:11,679
>> Mhm.

1933
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,080
>> And uh a smear campaign against him by

1934
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,760
the bishop, which happens, you know, but

1935
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,280
but this is what happens to people who

1936
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,640
try to follow Christ. We're going to be

1937
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:19,840
slandered. People are going to say

1938
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,000
things.

1939
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,080
>> Yeah. That that that

1940
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,239
particularly that St. uh the the pope

1941
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:27,920
and the the pope and the patriarch

1942
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,679
Bartholomew. You know, I just I sent you

1943
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:30,960
the book just recently, the history of

1944
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,440
the council of Florence and I translated

1945
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,960
I had bishop Oentios and and SA the Edna

1946
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,239
seminary actually translated the

1947
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,719
confession of St. Mark for me and he

1948
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:42,480
says I'm not going to be in communion

1949
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,560
with anybody that preaches heresy or

1950
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,840
anybody that's in communion with them.

1951
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,239
And then on his deathbed confession and

1952
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:50,320
he's emphatically clear, I'm not going

1953
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,280
to be in communion with you or anybody

1954
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,880
with you. So, and that that begs the

1955
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,159
question. That's what I was going to ask

1956
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,880
you is people, you know, people first

1957
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,880
they go to the well my priest is

1958
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,679
traditional and you know my bishop's not

1959
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:07,040
and it's like oh I don't care what the

1960
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,000
bishop does but it starts at the top.

1961
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,159
It's it's not people think like it's you

1962
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:13,760
know it starts with the priest and goes

1963
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,199
the the bishop but it all starts with

1964
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:17,840
the patriarchal senate down.

1965
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,600
So when the patriarchal senate is in

1966
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,719
heresy what do they do?

1967
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,760
So I remember the on my um the day of my

1968
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,760
enthronement as Metropolitan of America

1969
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,239
in my speech I mentioned that chain that

1970
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:31,760
it starts with Christ as the head of the

1971
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,880
church then you have the church then you

1972
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,080
have the senate then you have the bishop

1973
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,239
then you have the priest and then you

1974
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:39,120
have the uh monastic lay people and if

1975
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,840
there's some type of a break there

1976
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,040
you have to make sure that you are

1977
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,360
connected directly to the church to the

1978
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,640
senate which is representing the church

1979
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,159
so

1980
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,960
in my um sermon on accuminism. I think

1981
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,679
it was the Sunday orthodoxy. I mentioned

1982
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:57,520
that uh I'm afraid to think of what

1983
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,280
happens behind closed doors. If this

1984
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,520
stuff is all public, it's so public.

1985
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,400
What happens behind closed doors?

1986
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,840
Anyway, um

1987
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,440
at the very least, you know, we should

1988
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,040
be very careful about fighting the

1989
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,280
church as I said. So that is not the

1990
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,960
orthodox ecclesiology that you're under

1991
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,800
your bishop. You have to have a good

1992
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,400
relationship with your bishop. This is

1993
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,560
St. Ignatius is not much Paul Demetrius.

1994
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,960
You know this St. Ignatius the big guy,

1995
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,440
not me, the little guy, the nobody. St.

1996
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,760
Ignatius the gobber has a lot to say and

1997
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,880
he's not alone. There are so many

1998
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,440
fathers of the church. We're not making

1999
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,920
this stuff up. This is what we're

2000
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,320
finding in all the fathers.

2001
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,159
No, no, it's not the right way to do it.

2002
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,280
But no, well,

2003
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,440
what can I say? You know, everybody's

2004
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,600
free to make their own decisions.

2005
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,120
Yeah, that's that's what I found when I

2006
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,239
wrote the history when I wrote that

2007
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:50,960
book, the history of resistance. It was

2008
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,800
when I you know you know how I write my

2009
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,640
things, you know, scriptures, cannons,

2010
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,800
canonical interpreters, saints, fathers,

2011
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,760
lurggical text and and then I started

2012
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,080
getting into the patrolia grea which 90%

2013
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,000
of that has not ever been translated but

2014
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,400
you get into that and it's more flee

2015
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:10,560
flee flee you flee. So it's just

2016
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,000
>> so I'm saying at the very least it's

2017
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,520
like don't put yourself in a position to

2018
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,120
fight those who are actually doing what

2019
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,679
the father say

2020
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,840
>> but you know being being reviled he

2021
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,440
reviled not it says as I said in the

2022
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,360
epistles of St. Peter, continue. Glory

2023
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,640
to God.

2024
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,880
>> Glory to God. So, the the final question

2025
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,920
I have is concerning us in the United

2026
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,560
States and and the church abroad in the

2027
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,199
the GOC, you know, abroad and outside.

2028
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:38,800
How's since you've been the

2029
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,719
Metropolitan, how have you seen like the

2030
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,239
I know you've covered it a bit, but how

2031
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:45,600
have you seen the church grow uh in in

2032
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,800
America and overseas? And uh are are you

2033
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,920
witnessing uh in huge influx of I know

2034
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,000
you said you're getting calls and and

2035
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,440
what's your like vision for the future

2036
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,000
in the GOC like new clergy being

2037
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,480
ordained and what's our growth looking

2038
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,280
like?

2039
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,400
Well, as I mentioned earlier, we, you

2040
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,080
know, it's it says, I don't remember if

2041
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,600
we said it in this conversation, but

2042
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,480
before I think I mentioned it, that um

2043
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,920
um the Lord wants us to preach to all

2044
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,679
the nations,

2045
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:20,400
baptizing them, baptizing them in the

2046
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,520
name of the Father and of the Son, and

2047
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,120
the Holy Spirit, teaching them to

2048
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,800
observe all things.

2049
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,600
>> Mhm.

2050
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,719
>> And uh tomorrow I'm gone. You know, the

2051
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:30,000
church is the church. This is not my

2052
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,679
personal franchise thing. As I said, I'm

2053
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:33,199
making a point of that. That's why we

2054
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,800
came here. If I want to do that, I would

2055
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,760
have stayed where I was before.

2056
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,080
>> But um

2057
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,159
the idea is that, you know, if we work

2058
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:45,040
for the good of the church and um and we

2059
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,280
want to follow Christ's holy precepts,

2060
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,440
then we have to we'll preach the

2061
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,199
nations. And we're out there. As you

2062
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,199
mentioned, you know, the Orthodox

2063
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:56,400
tradition uh channel is growing and uh

2064
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,320
people are listening. And so I'm getting

2065
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,840
phone calls. I'm getting a lot of phone

2066
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,640
calls and I'm getting messages. It's

2067
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,080
true. And um there are plenty of people

2068
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,920
who have conscience pangs. But then what

2069
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,920
happens is sometimes

2070
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,679
in the midst of this whole conscience

2071
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:13,840
pan thing, their voice is the the the

2072
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,840
voice of God within them is crying out

2073
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,679
to them.

2074
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,199
But then somebody comes and tries to

2075
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:23,360
foil the plans of uh of God.

2076
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,520
>> And that's of course the enemy. And he

2077
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,280
works through c through certain people

2078
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,960
at different times.

2079
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,560
But um but I would say probably most of

2080
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,320
the people who contact us

2081
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,840
um end up coming along and u people who

2082
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,679
visit you know the people who visit have

2083
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:44,320
life-changing experiences. It's so

2084
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,480
interesting how you know they'll be told

2085
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,760
don't go there and then you have other

2086
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,679
people who come here and it's like their

2087
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:51,920
whole life changes. You know you visit

2088
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,320
you visit you visit a monastery but also

2089
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,400
monasteries are monasteries and you know

2090
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,840
that's what happens. But even in our

2091
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,640
parishes, uh maybe not to the same

2092
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,360
degree, but in our parishes as well, um

2093
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,880
people, a lot of people notice something

2094
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,120
and uh they'll they'll comment on it and

2095
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,840
and that's God's grace pulling them

2096
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,159
towards the church. So I would just tell

2097
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:16,719
people to pray

2098
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:19,040
with sincerity

2099
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,199
and that God would lead you to truth and

2100
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:23,920
and the Lord does not abandon those who

2101
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,960
love him and those who try to follow him

2102
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,560
with their whole heart. This is what we

2103
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,000
know. And so uh

2104
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,760
uh you know I'm not specifically

2105
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,280
judging anybody personally.

2106
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,600
As I said that's God's work. He's what

2107
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,280
he's going to do in the end. But we do

2108
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,880
uh we do need to preserve the purity of

2109
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,640
the of the faith so that it doesn't get

2110
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,800
so that the sweet wine doesn't get mixed

2111
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,800
with uh

2112
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,960
poison. So my vision for the church

2113
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,920
would be that we concentrate on Christ

2114
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,000
and the saints. I stress the saints a

2115
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,800
lot because I grew up with that and I

2116
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,400
know that that was one of the beautiful

2117
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,080
things that was passed down to me from

2118
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,360
my grandmother, my mother, my ancestors

2119
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,600
is that my grandmother would never start

2120
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,320
the day without saying may the saints of

2121
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,560
today help us. That was the conver

2122
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,960
beginning of the conversation sign of

2123
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,880
the cross may saint so and so whoever we

2124
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,520
celebrated that day help us. In Greek,

2125
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,000
it's a common saying, you know, may the

2126
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,840
saints help us. And um

2127
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,320
um if we focus on Christ and we focus on

2128
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,800
the good of the church and um we're not

2129
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,679
interested in any type of personality,

2130
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:38,000
cults or anything like that. Uh like I

2131
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,239
said, tomorrow I'm gone, somebody else

2132
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:42,880
will be here. uh we just want to make

2133
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,920
sure that the um that we preserve our

2134
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,360
union our unity among ourselves because

2135
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,760
it's very important because we pray this

2136
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,040
in the divine liturgy. The divine

2137
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,800
liturgy is the service of the unity of

2138
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,880
the church. Union with God, union with

2139
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,800
one another

2140
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,280
so much so that it's expressed in the

2141
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,760
divine liturgy itself. We ask God to

2142
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,440
grant unto us with one mouth and one

2143
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,239
heart to praise him. That's a petition

2144
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:11,360
that we ask, the priest asks um among

2145
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,440
the first, he commemorates his bishop

2146
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,400
because who else you going to

2147
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,920
commemorate? Because he's the one that's

2148
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,840
responsible for guiding you to to Christ

2149
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,800
uh by holding on to the uh doctrines of

2150
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,440
the Orthodox faith.

2151
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,400
And um and then we have this dialogue, I

2152
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,440
talk about it a lot, you might have

2153
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,560
heard me say it, and we have this

2154
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,400
dialogue which is starts with the

2155
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,880
epistles of St. Paul grace of our Lord

2156
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,480
Jesus Christ, love of God the Father and

2157
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,840
the communion of Holy Spirit be with you

2158
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,760
all and with thy spirit. You know this

2159
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,080
is this is real unity.

2160
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,760
Let us lift up our hearts. We lift them

2161
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,360
to the Lord. Let us give thanks unto the

2162
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,040
Lord and we start giving thanks unto the

2163
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,040
Lord in the holy Eucharist of

2164
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,840
Eucharistia.

2165
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,440
And our life is centered around that.

2166
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,520
That's one of the things that I really

2167
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,199
really noticed and uh deeply was um

2168
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,520
imprinted on me was that the life of

2169
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,280
Elder Joen was that in the divine

2170
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:07,280
liturgy. And this was St. um

2171
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,639
St. John the Ladder and many of the

2172
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:10,800
fathers say that prayer is the mirror of

2173
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,360
your soul. If you're going to be with

2174
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,960
God, the moment of prayer is really the

2175
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,040
divine liturgy paralons. It's the time

2176
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,520
when we're united to Christ and we have

2177
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,239
the liturgies going on. Um and that's a

2178
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:24,000
major thing and we have all the holy

2179
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,560
relics we have and we have the saints

2180
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,520
and uh they they work they're helping us

2181
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,920
and we need to continue to pray to them

2182
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,440
and have a good understanding of all

2183
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,880
those things. So it's like we have to

2184
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,080
have the foundation which is the

2185
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,920
orthodox faith but then we have to have

2186
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,800
the orthopraxia living the orthodox life

2187
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,000
and uh and one of my uh concerns is as

2188
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,880
the bishop and coming from where I come

2189
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,280
from as well where we had this sort of

2190
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,639
protected uh where I had a sort of

2191
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:55,280
protected youth and growth was is is a

2192
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,800
simple village piety it's so deep so

2193
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,960
deep and it's really the orthodox life

2194
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,639
lived

2195
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:04,239
and I'm concerned about that because you

2196
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:05,520
know a lot of people convert to the

2197
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,360
Orthodox faith who come to us and they

2198
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,159
don't have that background

2199
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:12,159
and that's a lot of things that's you

2200
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:13,840
know venerating the icons ving the

2201
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:17,040
relics lighting candles making prophing

2202
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,920
candles bringing flowers to church and

2203
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:24,199
donations and things like that

2204
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,880
>> I think that the the culture that we

2205
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,400
grew up with is you wouldn't even you

2206
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,840
can even see the priest without giving

2207
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,760
him something a little bit of money that

2208
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,600
we you know we don't fall into the

2209
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,760
temptation of avarice but

2210
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,159
>> um it's a a manifestation of you want to

2211
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:40,320
give something you know love if the

2212
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,600
priest comes to bless your house or

2213
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,960
something like that or you you know

2214
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,880
obviously we do the 40-day liturgies or

2215
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,080
liturgies you you give um which helps us

2216
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,080
fight a

2217
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,760
um and bringing oil to church or

2218
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,639
bringing wine to church and uh a whole

2219
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:56,239
list of things and of course I've been

2220
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:58,960
cultivating a prayer rule and all these

2221
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,440
things are important and essentially as

2222
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,880
I've said and I continue to Okay. And

2223
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,719
may God be me with it to say it to the

2224
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:06,800
end. Repentance.

2225
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,280
It's the way that we know Christ.

2226
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,840
>> Yeah, that's I've definitely I've

2227
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,159
noticed that my experience coming into

2228
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:16,639
the GOC. That's my one of the and I'm

2229
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:18,000
glad you pointed that out. You brought

2230
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,199
that up is the piety of life is you know

2231
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:22,880
with like Father George and Father John

2232
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,920
their cycle of services is it's almost a

2233
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,639
be it's almost monastic. They you know

2234
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:31,199
cycle services constantly. It's with,

2235
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,679
you know, Father Steven, um, Father

2236
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:36,320
Steven Allen, Father Andrew Kenses, and

2237
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,679
and my the Bro priest here that I that

2238
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:42,480
I'm, uh, I confess to here and, Father

2239
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:47,520
Andrew Frick, they're the piety is it's

2240
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,760
I've never I I've never met priests like

2241
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,920
them who are actually, you know, they

2242
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,360
they don't just look the role, they

2243
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,199
actually live it. and and it's I don't

2244
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:57,760
want to I don't want to swallow their

2245
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,679
heads, but you know, I've never That's

2246
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:02,560
one of the key fact key highlights of

2247
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,239
being in the GOC the last three years as

2248
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:07,600
I've noticed is our priests are just

2249
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,280
good stock, good quality.

2250
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,480
>> Yeah. You're not really swelling their

2251
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,480
heads. That's the norm. When you don't

2252
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,400
see that, then they've got a problem.

2253
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,560
>> Uh and and that's that's the problem is

2254
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,159
there's a lot of secularism that has

2255
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:20,239
really really entered into some of these

2256
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:21,920
other jurisdictions. But thank God we

2257
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,600
should all pray for our priests. I think

2258
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,920
we have good group of people. May God

2259
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,239
protect them all.

2260
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:31,600
>> Yeah, that was Thank you for that's that

2261
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,760
was all the questions I had and I'm glad

2262
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,600
I was able to get to talk to you. And do

2263
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,760
you have any final words for our viewers

2264
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,600
and if they want to come to the GOC if

2265
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,400
they're on the fence, if uh their mind

2266
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,239
is still, you know, their conscious is

2267
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,080
still pricricked about, you know, if

2268
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,400
they should come or not or

2269
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:52,960
>> Well, come and see. Come and see.

2270
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,320
Don't shut the doors. Be very careful.

2271
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,040
Um and and one of the other themes that

2272
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,600
I talk about is downloading information

2273
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,760
because if we're going to be fair, you

2274
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,280
know, and you come with the wrong

2275
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,679
spirit, uh you'll find something. You

2276
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:08,960
always you can always find something

2277
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,800
with somebody. But if you have a good

2278
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:16,239
sincere desire for Christ,

2279
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:18,239
come and see. And then we'll go from

2280
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,880
come and see to taste and see. Because

2281
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,280
when you taste of Christ, you'll see

2282
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,360
that uh the grace of God is fully

2283
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:29,840
manifest in his holy church. And that um

2284
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,520
if we develop our spiritual senses,

2285
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,760
which I talk about all the time as well,

2286
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,840
slowly we'll be able to discover a world

2287
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,840
uh which is the world at least

2288
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,600
scratching the surface, let's say, the

2289
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,600
world which awaits us. And that's

2290
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,639
ultimately our goal. We're not Orthodox

2291
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:49,120
for any other reason but to be members

2292
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,760
of the of the household of Christ in the

2293
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,480
heavenly kingdom. So may God grant that

2294
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,679
to all of us. And um I pray for all the

2295
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:00,239
well-intentioned people out there um who

2296
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:01,920
are not with us. We're not in communion

2297
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,159
with the GOC. As as I said, you know,

2298
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:05,679
God judges them according to his own

2299
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,440
judgments. I don't know who they are. I

2300
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,719
don't know what they are. I can't get

2301
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:12,880
into their hearts. But um

2302
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,880
you we made a good point of St. Serial

2303
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,239
of Kazan. You know, there's a difference

2304
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:19,520
between knowing and not knowing.

2305
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,280
>> And God's going to judge those who don't

2306
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,960
know in one way and God's going to judge

2307
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,480
those who do know another way. And then

2308
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,920
I think he's going to judge those who

2309
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,600
know and who still fight uh those who

2310
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,280
are following the precepts of the holy

2311
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:34,000
fathers when the fathers say flee.

2312
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:34,320
>> Yeah.

2313
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,199
>> Then that's another level. And I'm, you

2314
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:39,520
know, we don't want we don't want

2315
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,600
hellfire on anybody. We want our

2316
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,199
salvation, their salvation. We want

2317
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:45,440
everybody's salvation. So, may God bless

2318
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,600
and may God protect and may God bless

2319
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,880
the work of the church and may God

2320
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,560
deliver us from the all the temptations

2321
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,920
of the evil demons and their schemes.

2322
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,840
They're always scheming.

2323
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,080
And I ask everybody since you give me

2324
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,600
the opportunity to pray for me too and

2325
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,760
for our sacred metropolis.

2326
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,400
I count on everybody's prayers and uh

2327
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,320
may God keep us united in love the

2328
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,000
flock. That's one of the things that I

2329
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,400
thank God for that seems to me that um

2330
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,159
we have a good relationship with the

2331
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:18,560
flock and that's a blessing for me as

2332
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,639
the Metropol that I'm not worthy of it

2333
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:24,320
but I I ask them to continue to pray for

2334
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,920
me and remember and understand what

2335
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:26,880
you're saying in the beginning of the

2336
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,960
divine in the after the consecration

2337
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,639
beginning after the consecration where

2338
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:33,840
we say among the first remember Lord our

2339
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:38,000
archbishop Demetrius. So

2340
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,400
and uh I in turn also pray for the flock

2341
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:47,040
and um and my my love to all of you. May

2342
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,360
Christ our savior deem us worthy also to

2343
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,600
come to the feast of theophony which is

2344
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,280
just around the corner. You know it says

2345
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:56,400
in the uh services when we get to St.

2346
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,320
Basil's feast somewhere there at the

2347
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,400
apothec nativity it says great was the

2348
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,239
feast that passed but greater is the

2349
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:04,320
feast that is ahead. And a lot of people

2350
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,000
don't know that. Mhm.

2351
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,679
>> So everybody should try to make it to

2352
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:08,960
church because the blessing the great

2353
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,880
blessing of the holy waters is a major

2354
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:14,320
event and a great blessing. So uh with

2355
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,960
that said I thank you

2356
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,440
uh so beginning may God protect you and

2357
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:23,440
help you bless us and thank you.

2358
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:26,880
>> May God bless God bless you.

2359
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,960

2360
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,080
