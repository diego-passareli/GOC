34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,159
>> Okay. Well,

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,840
I was brought up in the church, thank

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,000
God. My parents uh come from a village

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,400
in northern Greece

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,960
uh was a Slav speaking village and uh so

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,439
you know it was hearing the church

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,280
savonic of course was somewhat

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,600
recognizable but I I grew up mostly the

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,680
the Greek parish of St. Nario in Toronto

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,840
and uh my uh my grandmother left a very

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,360
deep influence in my life. She was uh

45
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,200
the one that led us all to that church

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,360
basically.

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,439
Her sister actually the the parish was

48
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,840
uh we had around 500 families. It's very

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,600
large parish

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,159
and um St. Tyrus himself would appear to

51
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,840
people and sometimes and tell them I

52
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,760
want you to go to my parish. And uh

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,720
my grandmother had doubts actually about

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,400
the uh old calendar because you know the

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,160
old-timers in that area were uh very

56
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,280
much staunch defenders of the uh

57
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,760
traditions of the church. And so um

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,480
uh she had a few uh major miracles which

59
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,160
confirmed

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,959
that uh that it's not a small issue that

61
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,400
the church needs to hold on to the

62
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
traditions that disunityity in the

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,920
church was uh began with the change of

64
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,560
the calendar and of course it to this

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,040
day um those people in those

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
jurisdictions patriarchets don't

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,560
celebrate together and sometimes they

68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,120
celebrate two times

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,040
uh you know clergy from Greece, bishops

70
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,400
from Greece will go to Mount Aus and

71
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,760
celebrate the old calendar in the day

72
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,760
celebrate the new calendar

73
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,440
and uh she was just a very saintly

74
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,879
person you know she she a lot of people

75
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,080
could say you know my grandmother

76
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,200
brought me to church and all this kind

77
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,560
of stuff but it was it was really beyond

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,239
that it was super human it was uh was

79
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,879
someone who um

80
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,120
just loved God so much you read

81
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
sometimes in the lives of the saints

82
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,599
It's it you know only grace could could

83
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,920
u aid these people to be so cetical and

84
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,680
um so without any exception it was

85
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,720
always all day all night prayers

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,319
she just continuously making the sign on

87
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,599
the cross always praying and and just a

88
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,920
beautiful example which I cannot really

89
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,599
imitate quite frankly because it was

90
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,120
above

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,159
uh and and there were just so many signs

92
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,319
of real grace in this person and and the

93
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,000
first few years of my life we sort of

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,319
lived in

95
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,799
area of Toronto which is called Danforth

96
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,519
very close to Greek town.

97
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,680
So we lived very close just a couple

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,840
blocks away from my grandmother and so

99
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,079
as a child I would I would spend a lot

100
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,639
of time there at sleepover for extended

101
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,079
periods of time. Then we moved and then

102
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,680
they would spend extended periods, my

103
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,840
grandparents would uh spend extended

104
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,639
periods of time with us. And the system

105
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,000
that we had was that my grandfather

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,720
would stay in the um spare room and my

107
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,240
grandmother would stay in my room and

108
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,720
she she'd just be praying all night all

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,600
all night. And she just like literally

110
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,240
all night tears growing going through

111
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,000
her eyes. I remember you know waking up

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,320
with her hands up and she just streaming

113
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,160
tears

114
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,720
and uh it didn't bother me. I was

115
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,280
because you know from the time I was as

116
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,160
long as I can remember um

117
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,440
you know I was very much into uh I went

118
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,600
to church and I I I I loved going to

119
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,280
church and I

120
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,000
>> I said my my mother God bless her you

121
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,479
know she brought us up in the faith but

122
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,320
my grandmother was the one my mother was

123
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,479
pious my grandmother's

124
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,400
holy

125
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,479
and um

126
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,240
so she left an influence in the family

127
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
everybody

128
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,479
went to uh synctic taris. She sort of

129
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,199
led the way

130
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,840
and um

131
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
as I said it was it was really all night

132
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,479
long prayers and and unbelievable

133
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,000
fasting and uh so I I grew up hearing

134
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,919
things from the old country. You know

135
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,639
how they uh it was almost like we were

136
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,759
in this protected little

137
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,720
>> nucleus and uh she would tell me about

138
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,880
things back in the old country and

139
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,120
sometimes about specifically about the

140
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,759
church calendar issues and how the

141
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,360
faithful and how the grandmother who

142
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,759
lived with her

143
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,800
who subsequently was uh her ending was

144
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,560
so blessed that she told everybody okay

145
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
I'm going to be dying she

146
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,199
>> she yeah what happened was that her

147
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,400
guard heard an angel appeared to her and

148
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,680
told her, "I'm taking your soul."
