299
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,399
>> And um but what happened was uh when I

300
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,279
brought it up to the uh the yand of the

301
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,040
monastery actually was the ab monaster's

302
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,800
father Isaac

303
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,160
um he really took it personally. He was

304
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,000
he didn't want to you know I was young

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,279
blood and everything I guess he just

306
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,880
didn't want to lose me.

307
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,079
>> Mhm.

308
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,560
>> And uh the plan Metropol mar's plan the

309
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,240
bishop of Toronto just fizzled out

310
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,320
and I was there and I stayed there for

311
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,079
around 18 years.

312
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:40,480
>> Mhm.

313
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,959
>> And uh they made me a bishop you know

314
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,240
after 10 years. I was 31

315
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,800
uh 11 years and um and from the very

316
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,320
beginning I was talking about uniting

317
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,480
with our church because it's one of the

318
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,399
things that all the join serve I you

319
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,880
know I I um I really think it's his

320
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,560
prayers too and his blessings and St.

321
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,519
John who was a friend of bishop Petros

322
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,160
of Atoria

323
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,680
uh because it was right after I visited

324
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,279
St. John in San Francisco for the first

325
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,279
time that things started really moving

326
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,279
but from the very beginning uh everybody

327
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,920
knows this I wasn't hiding it I I kept

328
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,880
saying we need to unite with the uh sen

329
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,240
>> finally we came to the uh conclusion

330
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,279
actually decision hna decided in 2010

331
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,320
that the canonical senate in Greece is

332
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
um the senate under archbishop of

333
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
kalinos

334
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,760
it was right after the repose of

335
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,120
Archbishop Bros. We sent uh letters of

336
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,760
condolences. I went personally the sit

337
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,120
>> and uh I think that the Lord wanted us

338
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,160
to um confess our faith because it's not

339
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,959
as if what I considered

340
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,519
um a perfect opportunity for them silver

341
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,360
platter for the entire for all of them

342
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,600
to go over there and just humble

343
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,480
themselves like like the former

344
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
Cyprianites did you know I have to say

345
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,440
Metropolan Kipos Jr.

346
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,240
Mhm.

347
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,839
>> Uh

348
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,920
uh Bishop Clement, Bishop Ambrose, they

349
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,199
all asked for prayer, forgiveness

350
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,839
took off their panas

351
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,760
and this was edifying.

352
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,480
>> Mhm.

353
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,399
>> Uh so um so that's you know that's the

354
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,760
whole the whole u idea is being humbled

355
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,560
and and so and being humble and going

356
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,079
back because repentance heals. So this

357
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,839
is the reason why I um I I went on my

358
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,120
own because they um

359
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,440
they started fighting back. They didn't

360
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,680
want after afterwards they didn't want

361
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
to um

362
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,839
join Arsenad and they started defaming

363
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,160
Arsen. And this is why I recognize this

364
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,000
from the side groups.

365
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,560
>> Mhm.

366
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,240
>> Because they have to have some type of

367
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,000
uh

368
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,160
point for their existence because a lot

369
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,959
of them don't have a reason to exist.

370
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:07,279
Yeah.

371
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,120
>> And uh and so they're saying that

372
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,639
whatever they can throw out, it's it

373
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,399
reminds me very much of the phariseaical

374
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,279
thing about, you know, just catch him at

375
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,079
his words, try to find something against

376
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,519
him. And so they did that and they're

377
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,040
saying things like we're cypriites.

378
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,959
People who,

379
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,440
by the way, were in communion with the

380
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,399
cypriionites when they were crianites.

381
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,480
>> And now that they're not crianites,

382
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,199
they're pointing fingers. So in any

383
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,680
case, um

384
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,199
I went off a little bit on that, but the

385
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,920
thing is I do want to uh stress that it

386
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,199
was a beautiful addition to our senate

387
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,160
and that they were uh in an edifying way

388
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,480
very they came in a with humility

389
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,160
>> and that's how I went to the senad when

390
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,480
I had to leave on my own because of the

391
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,160
circumstances and I went to the

392
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,000
archbishop and I said I'm coming in

393
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,320
repentance

394
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
and uh as I said that's what what brings

395
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,079
his healing uh because uh you know there

396
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,440
was a little bit of a gray area with

397
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,519
Archishbentios and because he was

398
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,600
formerly the archbishop. So on Manos

399
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,279
what happened was in the 80s and 90s up

400
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,880
until his repose there was still a

401
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,320
little bit of consolation going on

402
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,600
between the two factions clergy from the

403
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,120
two groups would conceal at the

404
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,639
monastery of his men.

405
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,399
Uh

406
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,160
but even you know I learned from Elder

407
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,720
Joakim that uh who who personally

408
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,399
respected our church bakant just like a

409
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,000
lot of people in our church you know

410
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,639
you'll find his photograph everywhere

411
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,320
>> and uh for the record he u

412
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,959
he wanted to resign and he wanted

413
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,880
everybody to go under our church but he

414
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,560
was talked out of it by some clergy in

415
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,240
Boston at the time unfortunately

416
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,839
uh that could have been healed and but

417
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,360
anyway may God remember his good

418
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,600
intentions and he was humble about the

419
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,079
fact that he made a lot of mistakes.

420
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,039
>> Mhm. And uh some of the people who try

421
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,559
to defend him like um the so-called

422
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,480
Macarian you know the they used to be

423
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,919
called the Libyans

424
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,799
>> they used to they now sort of try to

425
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,640
present themselves as the Oxentian

426
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,720
faction but

427
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,000
truth you know the truth of the matter

428
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,919
is actually Hopner was they were the

429
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,720
ones that uh buried Arches Bakantius and

430
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,240
the Marian Center was not in community

431
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,559
with Archish Bantius

432
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,640
and so what happens then is that Um

433
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,520
the um

434
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,000
they would bring up a a quote from a

435
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,559
cannon the ancient apostolic cannons

436
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,440
that the uh sinnard can do nothing

437
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,880
without the archbishop but they forgot

438
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,240
the second part of the canon which says

439
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,679
the archbishop can do nothing without

440
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,600
the sin and that was part of the problem

441
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,160
that was it led to such chaos which

442
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,400
people in Boston were saying too

443
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,320
>> up until the point where they joined

444
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,840
But like I said, you know, he's in

445
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,360
Argipics.

446
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,440
He's um almost everybody from his

447
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,880
jurisdiction ended up joining our

448
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,679
church, including his last real bishop,

449
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,440
which was Metropolitan Athanasius of

450
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,799
Lisa.
