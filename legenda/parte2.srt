151
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,160
grandfather, who was uh it was just

152
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,680
before Pasca, so he was in the other

153
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,919
villages selling meat because we were

154
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,160
sort of well off and he had a lot of

155
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,400
livestock and and um as soon as he came

156
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,240
home,

157
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
um she took off her head covering. She

158
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,160
was she was 105 years old at this time.

159
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,680
It's 1950s.

160
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,280
>> And she threw all of her hairs on my

161
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,560
grandparents head. And she said, "As

162
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,319
many hairs as I have, so many blessings

163
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,160
may you have. Please forgive me. I'm

164
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,080
leaving. My guardian angel came to take

165
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,240
my soul. We made a an agreement."

166
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,479
And then um

167
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,440
so and then she reposed right there and

168
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,319
she she told them she made a point

169
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,600
uh to follow the church calendar. Uh she

170
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,360
would not even though the local church

171
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,039
there was celebrating with the new

172
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,240
calendar.

173
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,440
>> Mhm.

174
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,039
uh

175
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,400
then um so that was a blessing for me.

176
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,840
It's also uh it centers me because like

177
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,800
I said it's above what I could ever be.

178
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,160
Then uh in 1988 we made our first trip

179
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
to Greece

180
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,120
and as a family and we visited my my

181
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,800
mother's aunt who lived in Kerata.

182
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,960
She lived right by the convent there and

183
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,599
there there was a a famous uh holy fool

184
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,520
for Christ's sake.

185
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,639
Uh and I I saw her on numerous occasions

186
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,800
during that that trip and that was a

187
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,400
real uh deep experience and it was a

188
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,800
real blessing for me

189
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,080
and I always wanted to become a

190
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,599
monastic. So my plan was to go to Mount

191
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,400
Aos and providentially

192
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,479
I found someone

193
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,680
who was uh in the desert uh of Mount Aos

194
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,199
and I had a correspondence with him from

195
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,000
time I was 14 years old and finally when

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,919
I was 19 I went and visited him and

197
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,599
stayed with him and I my plan was to

198
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,039
stay with him and to become a monk

199
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,720
there.

200
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Um

201
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,319
the bishop in Toronto talked me out of

202
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,080
it. The clergy sort of talked me out of

203
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,840
it

204
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,039
and um part of me is has uh is bothered

205
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,039
by that.

206
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,800
But I know that uh you know God's God's

207
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
plans, God's work, of course, God's

208
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,880
will.

209
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,880
And um this elder was way beyond what I

210
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,279
could ever imagine. I mean I thought I

211
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,959
remember because I had a habit of

212
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,640
writing letters to different shrines as

213
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,440
a child and I would ask for prayers and

214
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,880
ask them to light candles and ask them

215
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,640
to send holy oil and everything. But

216
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,000
when I got my first correspondence from

217
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,440
Elder Joel command I understood this is

218
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,839
different. This is somebody who's has to

219
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,880
be has to have a lot of grace. So when I

220
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,440
went there um I was deemed worthy to

221
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,640
stay with him for a while and they sort

222
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,680
of had me like a novice and uh you know

223
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,200
I was I didn't have a bless to talk to

224
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,519
visitors if they came by.

225
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,000
Ironically, you know the famous father

226
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,320
friend of

227
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
>> Kathon

228
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,519
>> from what I understand he actually told

229
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,959
the new calendars that that was a holy

230
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,040
man of the joy.

231
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,399
>> So new calendars would pass by uh while

232
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,959
I was there and um it was one of St.

233
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,000
Narus's hideouts and St. Narus

234
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,720
uh used to go there because the

235
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,640
spiritual grandfather of the Jokim whose

236
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,959
name was

237
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,600
friends with St. Narus,

238
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,920
the elder of Elder Yakim was present at

239
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,959
the appearance of the cross in 1925. His

240
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,480
name was Elder Nectario

241
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,360
and he was uh you know Elder Join

242
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,680
basically was like one of the fathers.

243
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,320
He was uh deep in the prayer. He would

244
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,920
never leave the mountain. He was uh he

245
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,200
would hardly go anywhere else. He was

246
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,360
just there in the desert saying his

247
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,920
prayers. And uh I'm telling you it was

248
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,760
just unbeliev I don't there aren't

249
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,880
people like that. I don't know if there

250
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,000
any if there's anybody like that anymore.

251
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
He was a succession of the

252
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,320
older Aayoras the fathers from Manathos

253
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
and

254
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,640
it's a man of God really.

255
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,040
>> Mhm.

256
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,519
>> And and we have here his vestments and

257
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,360
some of his relics and and actually he's

258
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,120
worked miracles.

259
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,640
So he works miracles and he you know we

260
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
feel his presence. So when somebody says

261
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,040
for example you know

262
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,480
uh how can we not accept u whatever

263
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,160
other elders or saints you know um I

264
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
mean this is what I know

265
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,519
>> this these are the people that uh led me

266
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,600
to Christ

267
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
and I have no doubt in my mind that

268
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,640
these were just people who were u

269
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,560
inspired by the Holy Spirit who deeply

270
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,600
had God in them whose very presence was

271
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,399
something very special

272
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,720
and I remember just the holy fool for

273
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,480
grac Daro when I first saw it was sort

274
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
of like a shock because the presence was

275
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,240
just so strong

276
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,399
and then Elder Join when he served he

277
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,560
was he was in another world he was

278
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,120
totally totally

279
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,480
enveloped in God's grace

280
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,399
so uh that you know in short those

281
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,000
people left a deep impression on me I uh

282
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,360
As I said, I wanted to become a monk

283
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,680
there with the holy other jok. And um

284
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,880
I wasn't even worthy to do that. But uh

285
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,240
I ended up uh what the bishop wanted me

286
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,200
to do was the bishop in Toronto who

287
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,040
reposed a few months ago, God, God have

288
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,000
mercy on his soul. God forgive him and

289
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,440
uh grant him whatever rest

290
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,000
is available from the Lord's by the

291
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,360
Lord's mercy and grace. um

292
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,200
he he wanted to start a small little

293
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,680
monastic community and so he told me go

294
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
to Boston for 6 months to 2 years and

295
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,160
then uh you'll come back because I

296
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,600
really never was interested in becoming

297
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,680
a monk in Boston actually.

298
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,079
>> Mhm.
